    "Description": "# Automatic Bonus Progression\n\nAn item rebalance mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous based on Pathfinder's [Automatic Bonus Progression](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/unchained-rules/automatic-bonus-progression/) ruleset. **This is not compatible with controllers.**\n\n![Progression screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/blob/main/screenshots/progression.png)\n\n### This mod creates a save dependency. Once you save with this mod enabled it must remain enabled or you will lose access to the save.\n\n### [Settings are NOT in UMM, they use Mod Menu](#mod-options) \n\n## Problems or Suggestions\n\nFile a [bug](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) or [feature request](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/issues/new?template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D). You can also reach me (@WittleWolfie) on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat) in the #mod-user-general channel.\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload [AutomaticBonusProgression.zip](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/releases/latest) and install it using ModFinder or Unity Mod Manager. Make sure to install [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core) and [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu) as well.\n\n### If you use this on an existing save, you'll need to respec both regular and mythic paths to get full functionality.\n\n### This doesn't work with controllers. You have to use mouse and keyboard.\n\n## How it works\n\nAutomatic Bonus Progression automatically grants stat bonuses usually provided by items which no longer provide them. As a result you are free to equip items based on their special abilities and effects.\n\n*Note: Items in game still list these bonuses in the UI, but they do not apply. I will likely never address this, as it is a huge effort to fix.*\n\n* **Armor Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Armor*\n    * +1 Chainmail\n* **Shield Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Shield*\n    * Armor attunement is lower when a shield is equipped\n* **Weapon Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Weapon*\n    * +1 Greataxe, Amulet of Mighty Fists +1\n* **Off-Hand Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Off-Hand Weapon/Secondary Natural Attacks*\n    * Weapon attunement is lower when dual wielding or using secondary natural attacks\n* **Resistance**: *+X Resistance to Saving Throws*\n    * Cloak of Resistance +1\n* **Deflection**: *+X Deflection to AC*\n    * Ring of Deflection +1\n* **Toughness**: *+X Enhancement to Natural Armor*\n    * e.g. Amulet of Natural Armor +1\n* **Mental Prowess**: *+X Enhancement to Mental Ability Score*\n    * Headband of Wisdom +2\n* **Physical Prowess**: *+X Enhancement to Physical Ability Score*\n    * Belt of Strength +2\n\n| Level  | Bonus |\n| :----: | ------------- |\n| 3      | +1 Resistance |\n| 4      | +1 Armor<br>+1 Weapon |\n| 5      | +1 Deflection |\n| 6      | +2 Mental Prowess |\n| 7      | +2 Physical Prowess |\n| 8      | +2 Resistance<br>+1 Shield<br>+1 Off-Hand<br>+1 Toughness |\n| 9      | +2 Armor<br>+2 Weapon |\n| 10     | +3 Resistance<br>+2 Deflection |\n| 11     | +4 or +2/+2 Mental Prowess |\n| 12     | +4 or +2/+2 Physical Prowess |\n| 13     | +4 Resistance<br>+2 Toughness<br>+4/+2 Mental Prowess<br>+4/+2 Physical Prowess |\n| 14     | +5 Resistance<br>+3 Armor, +2 Shield<br>+3 Weapon, +3 Off-Hand |\n| 15     | +4 Armor, +3 Shield<br>+4 Weapon, +3 Off-Hand<br>+6/+2 or +4/+4 Mental Prowess |\n| 16     | +3 Deflection<br>+3 Toughness<br>+6/+2 or +4/+4 Physical Prowess  |\n| 17     | +4 Deflection<br>+4 Tougness<br>+5 Armor<br>+5 Weapon<br>+6/+2/+2 or +4/+4/+2 Mental Prowess<br>+6/+2/+2 or +4/+4/+2 Physical Prowess |\n| 18     | +5 Deflection<br>+5 Tougness<br>+6/+4/+2 or +4/+4/+4 Mental Prowess<br>+6/+4/+2 or +4/+4/+4 Physical Prowess |\n| 19     | 3 Legendary Gifts  |\n| 20     | 5 Legendary Gifts  |\n\nMental Prowess and Physical Prowess allow you to select which ability scores to boost. The bonuses you receive are further customizable using Legendary Gifts, detailed below.\n\n![Legendary gifts screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/blob/main/screenshots/legendary_gifts.png)\n\nEach Legendary Gift allows you to select a different special bonus. In addition to the Legendary Gifts you receive at level 19 and 20, you receive 2 Legendary Gifts at every Mythic Level for a total of 28. If you are on the Legend path, you receive an additional Legendary Gift at level 22 and every two levels after.\n\n### Legendary Ability\n\nGain a +1 inherent bonus to any ability score. You can select this legendary gift multiple times, and it stacks up to +5 in any one ability score.\n\n### Legendary Prowess\n\nThis allows you to increase the bonuses granted by Physical Prowess or Mental Prowess. You cannot increase the bonus to any single ability score above +6.\n\n### Legendary Shieldmaster\n\nRemoves the armor enhancement bonus penalty applied when using a shield.\n\n### Legendary Twin Weapons\n\nRemoves the weapon enhancement bonus penalty applied when using off-hand or secondary weapons.\n\n### Legendary Enchantments\n\n![Attunement screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/blob/main/screenshots/attunement.png)\n\nAllows you to apply enchantments to your equipment (Armor, Shield, Weapon, Off-Hand). Each enchantment has an Enhancement Cost and you can apply enchantments with a total cost equal to your rank in the corresponding feature (max 5).\n\n#### Armor Enchantments\n\n*

Draconic Bloodline can be selected\n* Only a single Elemental Bloodline can be selected\n* The Winter Patron spell list more closely matches the tabletop version\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n* Heavenly Fire can be used 3 + Charisma Modifier times per day instead of just 3\n* Lord Beyond the Grave buff can bet set to permanent, preventing lag / encumberance issues while walking around\n* Serpent's Fang poison DC is calculated correctly\n* Serpent Friend grants +3 to Perception instead of +2, matching the feature description\n* Evasion can be selected as a Slayer's Advanced Talent\n\n## Reporting Problems\n\n### First, go to Settings > Mods > Character Options+ and turn on \"Enable Detailed Logs\"\n\n**Follow this guide: [So you want to report a WotR mod bug?](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/ModBugReports.md)** Ideally include a save file.\n\n1. Use [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) to install [Mewsifer Console](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole) and Mewsifer Console Menu\n2. Reproduce the issue in-game\n3. Open Settings > Mods > Mewsifer Console and select \"Mod Bug Report\"\n    * ![Mewsifer Console Menu screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/blob/main/screenshots/bug_report.png)\n4. File an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) and attach the generated bug report\n5. Include your save file in the bug report\n    * Saves are stored in `%UserProfile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Owlcat Games\\Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous\\Saved Games`\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* [Some buffs do not work with BubbleBuffs](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/issues/76)\n    * Also AoE indicators are not enabled in BubbleTweaks by default\n* Winter Witch's Frozen Caress hex does not apply DC increases from things like Elemental Focus; this will probably never be fixed.

    "Description": "# Combat Relief -- Crusade and Random Encounters\n\nMy continuation of [Combat Relief -- Crusade and Random Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/40)\n\n## Download\n\nI recommend using [Modfinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases) to download WotR mods. \n\nBut if you don't want to, here are the links for manual download (**Install only one, not both**):  \n- ### Latest version. Requires [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases).  \n[**LINK**](https://github.com/alterasc/CombatRelief/releases/latest)\n\n- ### Old version without ModMenu dependency   \nIn case you don't want to install ModMenu. Less functions, but deals with crusade the same.    \n[**LINK**](https://github.com/alterasc/CombatRelief/releases/download/1.3.1/CombatRelief-1.3.1.zip)\n\n## How to install:\n\n1. Use Unity Mod Manager.\n2. Remove 1.2.1 version of Combat Relief if you have it.\n3. Install ModMenu.\n4. Install this mod.\n\n## Functionality\n\n- ### Autowin of crusade battles  \nCrusaders' armies always win autoresolve. Don't forget to enable crusade setting \"Run the tactical combat automatically\".\n\n- ### Avoid random encounters   \nMakes your party always avoid random encounters. Story encounters during travel are unaffected by the mod.\n\n- ### Prevent Corruption  \nWhen enabled corruption is not gained during rest.\n\n- ### Skill roll modification (version 2.1.0+)\nAllows to set on each skill if you want to roll normally/take 10/take 20.  \nCan be set to work out of combat only.\nDisabled by default.\n\n- ### Teleport to skeleton mechant button (version 2.2.0+)\nTeleports you to skeleton merchant random encounter area.\nHas a check for game being main campaign, but other than that will teleport out of any situation and act. Don't use it to get there when you're not supposed to.   \nSo to be safe use it only when you're on global map.\n\n## Settings\n\nAny and all functions can be disabled in Options -> Mods -> CombatRelief. (Or in UMM if you're on version 1.3.1)    \nBy default all functions are enabled.   \nSettings can be save-specific. Meaning if you change them in loaded game, that will affect only this save. If you change them while in Main Menu, that's sets default for all saves where they are not overwritten by save-specific settings.     \nSettings affect game immediately, no restart is required.\n\n## Credits\n\nBtB/streikeferret - original Combat Relief mod creator\n\nPermission from him:\n\n> Anyone who wants to continue this mod is free to reverse engineer my existing DLLs.",

    "Description": "# Enduring rework - mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous\n\nChanges Enduring spells and Greater Enduring Spells mythic abilities to be the following\n\nEnduring Spells\n```\nPrerequisite: Metamagic (Extend Spell)\n\nYou've learned a way to prolong the effects of your beneficial extended spells.\nBenefit: Effects of your spells on your allies cast with extend metamagic applied that should last longer than an hour but shorter than 24 hours now last 24 hours. Effects that should last longer than 10 minutes (but no longer than 1 hour) last 1 hour. Effects that should last longer than 1 minute  (but no longer than 10 minutes) last 10 minutes.\n```\n\nGreater Enduring Spells\n```\nYou've mastered a way to prolong your beneficial spells.\nBenefit: In addition to existing benefits now effects of your spells on your allies cast with extend metamagic that should last longer than an hour are permanent.\n```\n\n### Note:\n**Unlike base game where \"longer than X\" is \"longer or equal\" here it's actually longer as written.**\n\nSo 1 minute extended spell will stay 1 minute. 1 minute 12 seconds will become 10 minutes.\n\nCave Fangs, Call Lightning, Call Lightning Storm won't become permanent, at max 1 day. Sorry if you already theorized this.\n\nDoes not introduce save dependency, so you can remove it any time.\n\nIf used together with Tabletop-Reworks, disable TT-Reworks changes to Enduring Spells. \nI've set up my mod to load afterwards and unconditionally overwrite TTT changes, but it's better to be safe.\n\n### My subjective reasoning behind this change:\nES without GES is worthless. No one needs to make 1hour+ long spells last longer.   \nWhile it's possible to throw Mage Armor and Freedom Of Movement on everyone and then rest to recover spell slots but number of such spells is relatively low and it's anything but interesting gameplay (especially if done on prepared caster)\n\nSo ES needed something to make it stand by itself.\n\nGES meanwhile is where most of the benefit is. It immediately allows min/level spell to last a day and at CL25 it includes round/level spells.   \nMy personal problem with that however is that 2 Mythic Abilities is too high of a price to make minute/level spells last longer and 25 CL is too high of a price to extend round/level price. If you're not playing merged spellbook character (I never do) than 25 CL is a very late game thing, unless you do some minmaxing to push your CL.\n\nSo I pushed most of the duration extending benefit to ES and to counter balance it a bit, only spells with Extend are affected. \nNow there's tangible benefits in extending spells that have low duration, but they won't be there forever with you.\n\nGES pushes some long duration buffs into permanent buffs. We both know your Barkskin will not suddenly run out ever. So let it always be there and not waste any more time on that.\n\nPotentially with my changes you (player) can have a character that exists to just throw these buffs permanently and then never ever be present in a party, but I'm not going to try to introduce logic to remove buffs if original caster is not present. As far I'm concerned this is a cheese that's too hard to fix, so it stays.\n\nIs my overhaul of ES/GES makes it stronger? I think so. But as I never play with them, because I think they are weak, I think buff is what they need. Does it go into overpowered territory? I don't think so, our opinions can differ.",

    "Description": "This is a mod to add additional slides to the epilogue for Wrath of The Righteous based on a plurality of quests and NPCs that do not have slides in the vanilla game. The mod has two \"modes.\" In the first mode (Integrated), the slides will appear between existing slides. In the second mode (Extra Slides), the slides will appear at the end of the vanilla slides. Integrated mode additionally will add some alterations to existing slides, mostly related to giving additional reactivity to companions in the secret ending. You select the mode you want to use via answers during the epilogue. You can activate Integrated mode on the first slide. You can activate Extra Slides mode (or choose to not see the epilogue expansion) on a new slide that appears after the companion section.\n<br />\n<br />Be aware that this mod adds a LOT of new slides. Checking with some of the tools I use for datamining indicates that I have added 235+ potential slides with 1225+ lines between those new slides. It is impossible to trigger everything in a single play through and some of them will replace existing slides, but 50%+ of the slides might be possible in a completionist run. For comparison, by my count there are 101 slides (81 normal end, 20 Aeon end) in the base game v. 2.1. So this mod will triple the number of available slides.\n<br />\n<br />A complete list of the new slides and their requirements can be found at the following locations:\n<br />[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_Kingmaker/comments/15bcvz6/expanded_epilogue_mod_slide_guide_part_1/]Reddit, Part 1[/url], has spoiler tags\n<br />[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_Kingmaker/comments/15he5gh/expanded_epilogue_mod_slide_guide_part_2/]Reddit, Part 2[/url], has spoiler tags\n<br />[url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qiST8ZFFqmRAFXgv6sSgZC9brWsRBtU3MzKk0A2HmYI/edit?usp=sharing]Google Docs[/url], does not have spoiler tags\n<br />\n<br />Most recent tested version: 2.2.1a (everything appears to be working)\n<br />\n<br />[b]HOW TO INSTALL[/b]\n<br />\n<br />1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager)\n<br />2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous\n<br />3. Download the Expanded Epilogue Mod\n<br />4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 3 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab or unzip the zip and move the Epilogue folder into the Mods folder in the Wrath root directory\n<br />\n<br />[b]MOD VERSION HISTORY[/b]\n<br />\n<br />1.1.0 - Update for version 2.2, adds 10 new slides including Bismuth, the three new \"animal companions,\" and DLC5 story specific slides.\n<br />1.0.0 - Full release on Nexus. Tested on 2.1.4v\n<br />0.1.0 - Beta release for code testing. Editing process is still ongoing.\n<br />\n<br />[b]KNOWN ISSUES[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The horse, ghost horse, blizzard elemental, and night gag \"animal companion\" slides do not use an image of the animal companion. For whatever reason, there is no full sized version of their portraits in the files. Every other animal companion has one, so I'm not sure why this is missing.\n<br />\n<br />[b]MOD COMPATIBILITY[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Expanded Epilogue should be compatible with nearly all mechanic focused mods. If someone someday makes a mod that adds a Mythic Path, that could potentially cause major compatibility issues. Hypothetically, minor issues could also arise if a mod were to add new versions of any of the items that are checked for (e.g., the crusade relics), but at most that should just result in a slide being skipped.\n<br />\n<br />Story expansion mods should all play nice with Extra Slides mode as it has a minimal footprint. Integrated mode will not show any newly added slides from other mods unless compatibility has been added. Currently I have added compatibility so that slides from the Woljiff Romance Mod and the Camellia Romance Expanded End will show if the corresponding mods are installed. I will do my best to add compatibility to any future story expansion mods I become aware of. To anyone working on story expansion mods, give me a heads up before it is released and I can try and add day-1 compatibility to your story-expansion mod.\n<br />\n<br />[b]SPECIAL THANKS[/b]\n<br />\n<br />WittleWolfie for creating Blueprint Core, which was used for creating this mod\n<br />Bubbles for creating Bubbleviewer, which was essential for quickly finding all the variables I used\n<br />Narria for porting Data Viewer and creating Toy Box, both of which were essential for testing this mod\n<br />Synval2436 for assisting while I was stuck on what to do with Daeran\n<br />\n<br />[b]BORING TECHNICAL STUFF FOR OTHER MODDERS[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Listing out all of the changes I make to existing blueprints as FYIs.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]bd86bfdb8f44c3c4bbc3f0bfb4358416, 70123ea602ce924468f54bdfd4f660c5, d649f17a42a8e0c418bb336ced272934, f4958714381a3044b8d83c0bba86c21c - Continue cues changed to add a new slide\n<br />[*]3cd7e56f1ad0a3b4e9a4f8b2801877f6 - Continue cues changed to add four new cue sequences before the existing cue sequences\n<br />[*]a3096e5b145badb448827a7336d86d02 - Cue sequence modified to add two new book pages near the beginning of the sequence\n<br />[*]5eb5abaf42ff76b4587fb1df66f2c2df, 8f234537d0e0e504ba7fa281f02a3601, 0d3303baa32884943993e556cd640107 - Book pages modified to add a new answer\n<br />[*]ae58532cb72b28b4eaaccb82eb78eaea - Dialog modified to start a new etude when the dialogue is started\n<br />[*]f722e574705700844b78e3fb26d0a0c8 - Conditions added to page\n<br />[*]f722e574705700844b78e3fb26d0a0c8, 18c7bbb3a6f7cdf4e98990b6f02685cf, 9af05128f0bf94349bde191f62aeba3d, 9a7a9aadb3ba30d4686387d0ef7bcc82, 9f67adedf4dacca439264db537a4b9f3, 223fd069ee25c784db2df011adbf10f8, 6ef6aa5c76e62564f950445d45613ef4, f1b5cd57aa76be44b9f754a208854ee7, 638d02e6ba15fca43861343af4d60fa1, 48f344caa8963c0429dd147b6ad00bee, 486574ba611578e40a00a8082fd8e65a, 2842a437c0db5ff46b3eb8afc65e89c1, 8534fc624cc202148add7b96510d7842, 9669bef01411fd2498a466d2aef63bca, e83fff8e997db8e439bf12e09225696a, 7937c8393a0e71f438ee49856eacf7e4, a4bd573be98f4997a5c7146cf86aa984 - Have all been altered to be Show Once.

Desna-specific and Daeran-in-the-party lines are available.\n[Lann romance: chapter 1]: Slightly changed the default lines that start his romance.

          "Changelog": "[chapter 4: start] New dialogues are available in Nexus after arriving in the Abyss for Seelah, Regill, Greybor, Woljif* (in his optional module to prevent any potential conflicts with 'Woljif romance mod').<br /><br />Lann and Camellia's new dialogues reference their respective romances, if active. <br />Lann's dialogue is also linked to his quest in this chapter.<br /><br />Unblocked Arueshalae's dialogue about Desna's protection for every player (even if they never saw the butterfiles saving Arueshalae)\n[chapter 4: ending] Fixed the post-Colyphyr discussion with the companions who were left at the Nexus: the player no longer needs to click [Talk to your companions] 50+ times to see all the replies. <br /><br />If any of the romanced companions (Daeran, Lann, Arueshalae, Camellia, or Sosiel) were not in the party, they now comment, too.\n[chapter 4: post-Arena] Added new post-Arena dialogues for Greybor (references his respect level) and romanced Camellia. Finished romanced Sosiel's dialogue (originally introduced in 0.9.6): now some lines can reference Sosiel's quest stage and Trever's fate. <br /><br />Fixed a bug of getting a mead bottle from Seelah (originally introduced in 0.9.6) too early before the Arena.\n[chapter 4: post-Arena] Added new post-Arena one-liners for most of the not-romanced and non-romanceable companions (except Seelah and Greybor, who already have full dialogues). <br />Daeran, Ember, Arueshale, Lann, Regill, Camellia, Sosiel, and Woljif* (in his separate optional mod) now greet the Commander with a special dialogue opening line.\n[chapter 4: camellia's Q2 at ten thousand delights] Fixed and enhanced the outcome of the doppelganger encounter (originally introduced in 0.9.6). Now Herrax always has something to say after you leave that room (peacefully or otherwise), and every companion (except Ember) has a chance to be mentioned. So all the party members could be disgusted equally!\n[chapter 4: during the Areelu meeting] If you choose the line where you don't believe Areelu, Daeran (and Seelah, if she is in the active party) will comment on her response about the gods.\n[chapter 4: post-Areelu revelation] Added a new dialogue for Greybor.\n[chapter 4: Lann's quest] Lann now recognizes the old Mongrel's chieftain - Wenduag's father - during his encounter with Savamelekh.<br /><br />In addition, we overhauled the lines in his Nexus dialogue that starts his quest. They now reference his new conversation from the chapter's start. We also added new, more friendly lines to the dialogue in front of Savamelekh's mansion. Because who talks to people like that?\n[chapter 2: Lost Chapel start] Added new lines for meeting Ember &amp; Daeran, Regill, and Sosiel. Now every Commander can appreciate Sosiel being alive without trying to hit on him.\n[chapter 1: Kenabres, but potentially everywhere] If you ask Lann about wearing a hat and you have the Magnificent Plume Hat from Commander's pack, then you'll be able to put it on him (choose \"I want to know more about you\"). <br /><br />(We'll definitely add all available hats; just this one is available from the start in Kenabres.)\n[Lann romance: sparring match in chapter 3] If the Commander is a spellcaster or if she does not like melee combat (fails the Athletics 28 check), Lann will comment on that. A spellcasting Commander also has a different line after the sparring match.\n[Lann romance: chapter 1] Changed his closing line for active romance (originally introduced in 0.9.5) in chapter 1, so he does not start simping after the Commander if she flirted with him ONCE."

    "Description": "[b]GreatRadiance\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Availability of unique magical weapons is largely restricted to either longswords or one of the weird exotic weapons like sai's which literally no one wants to use but the game is covered with. There are probably about 20 different named longswords in the game, to maybe 3-4 decent greatswords, arguably the most popular weapon for front-line martials in Pathfinder. And of course, the legendary Paladin weapon that plays a special role in the entire adventure...is also a longsword, because why make anyone want to actually use one of those 20 other ones?\n<br />\n<br />If you're like me you were profoundly disappointed when you discovered that the game would force you to choose between playing with the weapon you wanted to or having to pass the game's iconic sword to a companion. Especially since in the Adventure Path on which this is based, Radiance is actually supposed to transform into a Paladin's preferred weapon. This mod is my attempt to remedy that. [b]GreatRadiance[/b]Â changes all versions of Radiance into a greatsword, and gives all magical versions of it the Evil Outsider Bane enchantment for good measure, to make up for the inability to enchant weapons and the absence of the 'Oath of the Crusade' archetype.\n<br />\n<br />[i][b]DISCLAIMER: [/b]This mod is not made for installation with the Unity Mod Manager.Â [/i]Read the installation instructions very carefully. I am not a C# coder, therefore this mod was made utilizing Owlcat's Wrath Modification Template for Unity. Eventually this will be installable through the Steam workshop but until then there's no way around manual installation that I'm aware of.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation Instructions:\n<br />*[i]A thorough installation manual in pdf format with extensive screenshot clarification is now available in the 'Files'Â  section under 'Miscellaneous'.[/i]\n<br />1.[/b]Â Navigate toÂ [i]user-folder[/i]/AppData/LocalLow/Owlcat Games/Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous/ and create a new folder named 'Modifications'. \n<br />[b]2.[/b] Unzip the mod and place the 'GreatRadiance' folder and all its contents in there.\n<br />[b]3.[/b]Â Create a file named 'OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json' and place it withinÂ [i]user-folder[/i]/AppData/LocalLow/Owlcat Games/Pathfinder Wrath Of The Righteous/Â  Â [b]\n<br />[/b][b]*4. [/b]Open 'OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json' in notepad and add the modification to it by inputting:\n<br />{\n<br />Â  Â  Â \"EnabledModifications\": [\"GreatRadiance\"]Â  Â Â \n<br />}\n<br />[b]5.[/b]Â Obtain Radiance, either by playing until you find it or loading up a game in which you've already gotten it.\n<br />[b]6. [/b]Enjoy!Â \n<br />\n<br />*If you're running another Unity-developed Mod such as my BetterBackgrounds mod simultaneously, the syntax looks like this\n<br />{\n<br />Â  Â  Â  \"EnabledModifications\": [\"BetterBackgrounds\", \"GreatRadiance\"]\n<br />}\n<br />\n<br />[b]Alternate Versions:\n<br />[/b]There are numerous alternate versions of GreatRadiance available as an optional files which replace Radiance with weapons other than Greatsword. Installation is identical. It is [b]not[/b]Â possible to run multiple versions of this Mod at the same time. That said, it is simply a matter of swapping out the GreatRadiance folder in the Modifications folder to change between versions.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Bastard Sword[/b] - IllegitimateRadiance\n<br />[b]Dagger[/b]Â - StabbityRadiance\n<br />[b]*Double Axe[/b]Â - OrcRadiance\n<br />[b]Dueling Sword[/b] - AldoriRadiance\n<br />[b]Dwarven Waraxe[/b]Â - GimliRadiance\n<br />[b]EarthbreakerÂ [/b]-[b]Â [/b]SmashRadiance\n<br />[b]Elven Curve Blade [/b]-[b]Â [/b]CurvedRadiance\n<br />[b]Estoc[/b]Â - MatadorRadiance\n<br />[b]Falcata [/b]- AerekostesRadiance\n<br />[b]Falchion [/b]- CritRadiance\n<br />[b]Fauchard[/b]Â - GuanRadiance\n<br />[b]GlaiveÂ [/b]-[b]Â [/b]PoeticRadiance\n<br />[b]Greataxe[/b]Â - BarbaricRadiance\n<br />[b]Handaxe[/b]Â - HatchetRadiance\n<br />[b]Heavy Flail [/b]-[b]Â [/b]AkkhanRadiance\n<br />[b]Heavy Mace[/b]Â - MolagRadiance\n<br />[b]Kukri [/b]- NokRadiance\n<br />[b]Longbow[/b] - HunterRadiance\n<br />[b]Longspear[/b] - KnightlyRadiance\n<br />[b]Quarterstaff [/b]- StickRadiance\n<br />[b]Rapier [/b]- PointyRadiance\n<br />[b]Scimitar[/b] - DrizztRadiance\n<br />[b]Scythe [/b]- LichRadiance\n<br />[b]Shortspear [/b]- SpartanRadiance\n<br />[b]Shortsword[/b]Â - LesserRadiance\n<br />[b]Staffsling [/b]- KenderRadiance\n<br />[b]Starknife[/b] - StarRadiance\n<br />[b]Throwing Axe[/b]Â - ChuckRadiance\n<br />[b]Trident[/b]Â - TritonRadiance\n<br />[b]*Two-bladed Sword[/b]Â - RoninRadiance\n<br />[b]Warhammer[/b]Â - ToragRadiance\n<br />\n<br />[b]*[/b]If you convert Radiance to a double weapon, then load up a saved game that already has Radiance and has it equipped on a character, it will break your inventory. You'll need to use Toybox to remove the item altogether, then re-add it and equip it properly.\n<br />\n<br />[b]FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\n<br />Q: [/b]Help! I've followed the instructions but nothing happened - Radiance is still a longsword.\n<br />[b]A: [/b]Doublecheck the 'OwlcatModificationManagerSettings' file you created. Ensuring that file extensions are turned on, is the full name with extensions 'OwlcatModificationManangerSettings.json.txt'? If so, eliminate the '.txt' and that should fix the problem. If it's still not working, hit me up in the comments or over DM and I'll help you troubleshoot.\n<br />[b]Q: [/b]My game isn't starting.\n<br />[b]A: [/b]There is almost a 100% chance other mods are at fault here. The most common cause until recently was a conflict between AutoBuff and TableTopTweaks.\n<br />[b]Q: [/b]What about Natural Attacks/Unarmed Strikes?\n<br />[b]A: [/b]Unfortunately this is something I just can't figure out how to do right now. I do genuinely want to bring the option to use Radiance to monks, Paladins of Irori, and the like but it's just not within my ability at the moment. Rest assured I *will* make this option if and when that changes.\n<br />\n<br />If you enjoy this mod, my other mods are available at the links below:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/205]Better Backgrounds[/url]Â - Revamps the existing backgrounds and adds new ones to ensure background selection is meaningful for all characters\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/134?tab=description]Chrom (Matt Mercer) Voice Pack[/url]Â - Adds the voice of Chrom from Fire Emblem as a selectable voice\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/223]Lucina Voicepack[/url]Â -Â Adds the voice of Lucina from Fire Emblem as a selectable voice",

    "Description": "# Isekai Mod\nThis is a content mod for `Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous` that adds an `Isekai Protagonist` Class into the game.\n## Development Guide\n### Requirements\n- Visual Studio\n### Setup\n- Add `WrathPath` as an environment variable with the value `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Pathfinder Second Adventure` or wherever your game directory is.\n- Open Visual Studio and [publicize your assemblies](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki/Publicize-Assemblies).\n### Testing\n- Create a folder called `IsekaiMod` in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Pathfinder Second Adventure\\Mods`.\n- After building your solution in Visual Studio, go to your project directory -> `bin` -> `Release` or `Debug` -> `IsekaiMod` -> `net472`.\n- Copy the files and folders from the diagram below and place them in the `IsekaiMod` folder you created.\n- You'll need to create the `UserSettings` folder.

support for the following mods.\n### TabletopTweaks-Base (2.5.2)\nIf you have the `TabletopTweaks-Base` mod, the Isekai Protagonist will have all extra metamagics as OP ability options.\n### MysticalMayhem (0.1.5)\nIf you have the `MysticalMayhem` mod, the `Isekai Protagonist` will have the 9th level `Meteor Swarm` spell added to its spellbook.\n### ExpandedContent (0.5.2)\nIf you have the `ExpandedContent` mod, the `Isekai Protagonist` will have all the new spells add to its spellbook. You also get to choose drake companions.\n### SpellbookMerge (1.7.1)\nIf you have the `SpellbookMerge` mod, the `Isekai Protagonist` will be able to merge its spellbook with Aeon, Azata, Demon, and Trickster.\n\n### Any Mod adding spells to the base classes\nAs of version 4.0.0 there is an option to create the Isekai spell list by merging most of the non mythic ingame spell lists. That means that as long as the mod loads in before this one and adds the spell to at least one of those lists the Isekai Protagonist gets it too.\nThe list of spell lists we merge for this is fairly comprehensive, Cleric, Wizard, Druid,all the base game domains, all the different wizard specialisation lists, Witch, ...\nAs such almost no spell should need work on our part to add support for it, if you find one please let us know.\n\n## Credits\nThanks to Necht for fixing the Russian translation.\nThanks to komoechan for fixing the Chinese translation.\nThanks to kjk001 for contributing alot to this repository, improving the code to use TabletopTweaks-Core as well as adding lots of content.\nThanks to WittleWolfie for creating this modding guide that helped me get started:\n- https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki\n",

    "Description": "# KineticArchetypes\nA mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, focused on making more kineticist archetypes and other class archetypes that use kinetic blasts.\n\n# How to install\n\nThis mod is available in ModFinder. Alternatively, you can download the zip file in the [releases page](https://github.com/NosVladimir/KineticArchetypes/releases/) and drag it into ModFinder or UnityModManager.\n\n# Cross-mod compatibility\n\nShould be compatible with DarkCodex and KineticistElementsExpanded.\n\n# Contents\n### Fixes\nFixed the problem where taking burn from a kinetic blade would deactivate the blade after the first attack due to insufficient remaining burn. Kinetic blades now only deactivate if there is indeed no burn left for an attack, either at the start of a round, or during a round immediately after an attack command is issued.\n\n### General\nAdded an ability to allow for remembering a currently held weapon, so that when kinetic blades are formed, the remembered weapon's shape is used instead of a never-changing scimitar. This works the same way as the base game transmog system with the golem, but any visual effect coming from the remembered weapon's enchants sometimes appears sometimes not. I have no idea how to fix that.\n\nAdded infusion [Vital Blade](https://libraryofmetzofitz.fandom.com/wiki/Kinetic_Blade#VITAL_BLADE) that allows kinetic blades to work with vital strike and improved vital strike.\n\n### [Kinetic Duelist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/kinetic-duelist/)\n\nA kineticist archetype that allows legit two-weapon fighting with kinetic blades. Heavily homebrewed since gaining dual blades at 17th level is not very appealing.\n- Cannot choose form infusions that are >1st level and do not list kinetic blade as prerequisite\n- No infusions at 3rd and 9th levels, no supercharge, no metakinesis quicken\n- 0 burn kinetic blade at 1st level, can AoO\n- Off-hand kinetic blade at 3rd level, more attacks with it at 9th and 15th level\n- Recovers 1 burn in a burn-accepted round on first hit in a full-attack with kinetic blades from 11th level\n- Kinetic assault special charge. 3 burn, attacks with both blades and auto maximise\n\n### [Cinder Adept](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/paizo-llc-kineticist-archetypes/cinder-adept-kineticist-archetype/)\n\nFire-focused kineticist with a horse.\n- Must choose fire as primary and secondary element. Can still choose a different third element (in base game there is no benefit of choosing the same element except for the composite blast, so the third element is not restricted)\n- Trades 1st level infusion for Mounted Combat bonus feat \n- Trades 4th, 8th, 12th wild talents for a horse animal companion at level -3\n\n### Esoteric Blade\nA homebrew fighter archetype that has access to an energy kinetic blade, can make AoOs with it and use it for Cleaving Finishes and Vital Strikes.\n- Trades 1st level combat feat for a full-progression simple energy kinetic blade, and Str modifier for KB damage\n- Can multiclass with proper kineticist, adds up kinetic blast damage progression but reverts KB damage modifier to conform kineticist main stat (Con/Int/Wis/Cha)\n- Trades 4th level combat feat for KB AoO and KB combat feats including all Cleaving Finishes and all Vital Strikes\n- Trades weapon training 1/2/3/4 for weapon training (kinetic blade). Retains additional weapon type choices and advanced weapon training options. Works with anything dependent on weapon training, e.g. golves of dueling, all advanced weapon training features and Sohei's flurry\n- Trades 10th and 20th level combat feats for changing KB critical range and multiplier to be the same as remembered weapon's base type stats (see above for remembering a weapon). This doesn't account for weapon crit enchants\n\n### [Kinetic Lancer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/kinetic-lancer/)\nUsing kinetic spear, leaping around the battlefield to full-attack foes.\n- Trades 1st level infusion for a 0 burn kinetic blade and the ability to [jump](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/Acrobatics/#jumping-and-falling)\n- Signature ability: Dragoon Dive, leaping to a target and making a kinetic blade attack, with gather power during jumping. Trades some wilds talents and infusions to enhance Dragoon Dive, including lower jump DC, jumping full-attack, higher gather power burn reduction, extra attack, and bonus damage  \n- Trades 5th level infusion for Kinetic Spear, a longspear-shaped kinetic blade with reach and crit range 19-20\n- Trades 9th level infusion for impaling the target of Dragoon Dive, denying their standard actions\n\n### [Onslaught Blaster](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/onslaught-blaster/)\nConvert every single dice increase of kinetic blasts into an additional blast fired. Also works with AOE form infusions. **WARNING:** be careful when firing a lot of AOE form infusions, as it will likely cause frame rate drops for a short moment due to too much FX.\n- For every 1d6 damage increase of a normal blast (or every 2d6 for composites), convert it into one more blast fired at 1d6 (or 2d6), except for kinetic blades and wall/cloud/deadly ground\n- Has an automatic targeting mode for distributing the number of blasts among targets, based on their HP\n- Trades all metakinesis for increasing the number of blasts\n- Archetype exclusive feat [Kinetic Railgun](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/onslaught-blaster#Kinetic_Railgun) that further adds 1 blast and reduces burn cost when hasted\n- In base game, can fire at most 34 blasts in a single cast with greater kinetic diadem and lesser kineticist rod equipped\n\n# Known issues\n**If you encounter any bug, feel free to fire an issue!** English and Chinese are fine.\n\nTaking levels first in an esoteric blade then a proper kineticist would give you associated composite blasts right away. Not a big deal so not going to fix.\n\nUsing dragoon dive to initiate a battle would sometimes cause you to lose your attacks - that's because the enemy was moving too fast and by the end of the fixed-point jump it's out of reach. This can be partially mitigated by increasing the speed of the character, so jumping time is reduced. It would be too complicated to factor in moving targets in real time, so this is not going to be fixed.\n\nOnslaught blaster's targeted strike sometimes counts fewer blasts than actually fired.\n\nLevelling up during the casting animation of an onslaught blast may cause you to lose one dice permenantly. **Wait for some time until you see your equipments unlock, then level up!**\n\n# Planned contents\nCurrently no guaranteed future contents. Below is a list of archetypes I'm interested in and might try to implement, but given how bizzarre they are I cannot promise anything. Maybe also some more base game fixes around blade whirlwind.\n\n### [Elemental Annihilator](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/paizo-llc-kineticist-archetypes/elemental-annihilator-kineticist-archetype/)\nFeatures Devastating Infusion that can full-attack foes at 120 feet, but only deals a fixed 1d8+ConModifier dmg. Trades all wild talents for extra combat feats. Has a very powerful capstone at 20th level that's a composite infusion at 4 burn dealing 5*(10d6+10) bludgeoning+cold+electricity+fire+force dmg. I suppose it can also be used together with form infusions.\n\n### [Dread Soul](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/dread-soul/)\nEvil only. Forces others to take burn. Drains creatures souls to create soulstones.\n\n### [Nihilicist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/archetypes/legendary-games-kineticist-archetypes/nihilicist/)\nNull element - empty blast and zero blast, dealing direct non-lethal damage. Can convert into lethal damage with a standard action, plus some conditions to the target.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n- [WittleWolfie](https://github.com/WittleWolfie) for [BPCore](https://wittlewolfie.github.io/WW-Blueprint-Core/articles/intro.html) and [Vek17](https://github.com/Vek17) for [TTT-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core).

    "Description": "﻿# Kineticist Elements Expanded\n\nMod for Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous\n\n\n## Credits and Acknowledgement\n\nThanks to [Truinto][1] author of [Dark Codex][2] for providing help, advice, and some methods so I could gain my own footing in C# and modding P:WoTR\n\nThanks to the entire OwlCat community discord and the modding community there, for answering my plethora of strange questions and pushing me in the right directions\n\nThank you to [Adsam112][3] for some custom icon images for the Void Element\nThank you to [RevanStarForge][4] for some color variations of those images.

Currently this mod adds only the \"Aether\" element from the Tabletop version of Pathfinder.\nMore elements may be coming in the future.\n\nAdded elements means: More blast types, More infusions, wild talents, Elemental Defense, etc.\n\nThis mod originally started as a personal project to add my favorite element, Aether, to the game.

For whatever reason, it does not work with the Spindle infusion, still working on that\n\n### Admixtures\nThese work pretty well in all cases, I have only seen a single issue: When using either of the energy admixtures, and you crit, the damage modified by the admixture will not deal double damage, but the original damage type will.\nWhen using DarkCodex, admixtures are not added. I believe this is due to DarkCodex, and it is in Truinto's to-do backlog to make sure they are added\n\n### Wood Soldiers\nIt is possible, if you use the ability after one or two dies, to have up to 7 wood soldiers, still trying to figure out how to limit the amount of summons\nUsing the ability at 4 or more Soldiers causes you to take burn, but does not summon soldiers (Max 4, but the ability shouldnt go off)\n\n### Whirlwind and Blades\nBlades have a few issues, and whirlwind not working with modded blades is one of them. Reach out if you find more please\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/Truinto\n[2]: https://github.com/Truinto/DarkCodex\n[3]: https://github.com/Adsam112\n[4]: https://github.com/RevanStarforge\n[5]: https://github.com/q892398745\n",

    "Description": "# LevelUpPlanCustomizer mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous \n\nAllows you to customize pregens and companions automatic level up builds and enables auto level regardless of difficulty setting.\n\nNow with export for MC and story companions! (See How to try it section)\n\n## IMPORTANT: By itself this mod does NOT change any in game builds. Until you add them yourself, the only effect will be avilability of automatic level up regardless on setting.\n\nClarification on last point: this is done by bypassing the check of game setting entirely. So even if 'Off' is selected, auto level can happen until you take control of levelling process.\n\n\n## How it works\n\n1. Get pregen of MC or feature list of companion. Two options for that:\n\t- Write (or get someone else to write) level up plan for some character (either companion or your pregen) in specified format.\tPut it into `FeatureLists/` (for companions and other units) or `Pregens/` (for MC) folder inside mod install folder.\n\t- Load some save, open UMM mod menu and press export. This will output files directly into needed folder.\n2. It will be applied to characters that you haven't met yet. Meaning that pregen for MC can only be defined before starting the game.\n3. Just play.\n4. If at any point you want to remove the mod, you're free to do so. All existing characters will keep what they already picked and if your normal difficulty setting allows auto level, they will progress on plan that were defined for them.\n\n## What it can do\n- Replace existing in game pregens.\n- Replace companion level plans entirely. Meaning feat selections can be defined from lvl 1. But not stats (or race, or gender, or alignment). Once again reminder - this will only apply if you haven't met that companion yet.   \n- Edit feature selections of other in game units if for some reason you want to.\n\n## What it CAN't do\n- Change already met companions\n- Change companions stats, race, gender, alignment.\n- Change your level up plan if you're already following one\n- Pre-set pregen visual characteristics to your liking. You'll get default race/class look, that you can change during character creation.\n- Make builds that have normal progression depend on mythic progression (second bloodline feats or mythic feat extra mythic feat being a prerequisite for) (Will be solved in the future)\n\n## What can export do\n- It knows which classes you took and in which order\n- It tries to calculate level when you took feature selections.\n- It tries to guess what stat you raised on level ups. Mostly it assumes you put point into your highest stat\n- It takes all skills you put levels into and just throws them all. If your skill strategy is more complicated then max same skills, you will have to adjust output yourself\n- Game does not know which spell you learned when, so it throws all your known spells on each spellcaster level. Adjust spells learned yourself.\n\n## How to try it \n\n1. Load one of your saves.\n2. Export your MC overwriting one of the standard pregens.\n3. (Optional) Close the game and go open pregen in Pregens folder (file should be named after your character) and adjust skills taken and spells learned.\n4. Start new game with it.\n5. Toybox yourself to 20\n6. Enjoy clicking next while seeing levels go by. Hopefully :)\n\n\n## How to write feature list or pregen.  \nTake a look at [How to.md](/How%20to.md), I try to describe how it works, but it still requires a bit of technical knowledge and you will probably need additional tools.   \nLook at provided samples. Seelah alternative build is an easy example (just lvl20 paladin). Pregen is a Monk(SF)1/Sorc4/DD4/Ek10/Sorc1 gish, and it shows how multiclassed builds work. Note - neither of two builds are recommended, they're just samples.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\nIf level up plan stops for no reason that can be because of several reasons\n\nPossibility: Your character on that level depended on something gained from outside source. Game tries to evaluate plan entirely right when it first loads the character and if it forecasts that you for example won't be able to take this feat, it does not record this action for future use.  \nSolution: Don't do such builds for the moment, until I find a safe way to fix this. Alternatively enable ToyBox option that allows taking any feat without prerequisites and choose pregen with it enabled. Disable when you get control of your character.\n\nPossibility: something-something that I haven't encountered. \nSolution: try temporarily disabling experimental patches and reloading the game. If that doesn't help you will have to continue manually. If you want to help me troubleshoot please prepare pregen that you loaded and save file. (Or better yet if you have archive manager, open save with it since it's just a zip file and extract party.json out of it - that's the only file of interest).\n\n\nIf something during manual leveling process seems to go wrong, try disabling \"experimental\" patches and restarting the game.  \n",

Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 3 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab\n```\n## Added Content\n```\n* Added Summoner Class\n* 57 Different bodies for your Eidolon\n* 20 New Unique Spells, including the ever elusive Black Tentacles and Infernal Healing\n* 22 Eidolon Subtypes\n* 61 Evolutions to choose from some with multiple ranks\n* 828 Blueprints\n```\n## Change Log\n```\n\n```\n\n## Known Issues\n```\n* Eidolons do not qualify for all weapon focus feats.\n* If a character has more than 2 companions (such as an Eidolon+Aivu+Animal Companion), the UI breaks.\n* If a party has more than 13 units in total, the game breaks.\n* Attack animations won't play for certain body-types. This is because they don't have an animation for that attack, but the attack will still happen.\n* Sometimes even if your Eidolon has arms the game will lock the equipment slots, reloading your game fixes this issue.\n* Bonded Senses doesn't refresh when the eidolon changes their perception ranks, reloading your game fixes this issue.\n* Some eidolons are either too big or don't show at all in the inventory screen.\n```\n## Special Thanks\nThanks to @Vek17#1898, @bubbles#0538, @WittleWolfie#8477, and everyone else on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/owlcat). Without their assistance this project would not have been possible.\n\n\n## License\n[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)\n",

    "Description": "# MewsiferConsole\nAn improved remote console for reading logs in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous.\n\nFor reporting bugs to WotR mod devs, read [So you want to report a WotR mod bug?](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/ModBugReports.md)\n\n**Mod Developers: Add `MewsiferConsole.Mod` to `LoadAfter` in your `Info.json` to ensure all of your logs are captured.**\n\n```json\n\"LoadAfter\": [\"MewsiferConsole.Mod\"]\n```\n\n![Console screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/console.png)\n\n## Features\n\n* Captures Unity Mod Manager and Game logs\n* Filtering by Channel, Severity / Level, and text\n* De-dupe log events to reduce log spam\n* Bug report API to export a session which can be loaded into the console\n* Better performance than RemoteConsole\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (UMM), minimum version 0.23.0, and configure for use with Wrath\n2. Install [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) and use it to search for Mewsifer Console\n3. Click \"Install\"\n4. (Optional) Search for and install Mewsifer Console Menu and its dependency, [ModMenu]()\n    * Adds a button to the Mods menu which generates a bug report containing all logs from the current game session\n    * This is a great way to get bug reports from users\n\n![Menu options screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/menu.png)\n\nIf you don't want to use ModFinder you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/releases) and install normally using UMM.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installation run `%WrathPath%/Mods/MewsiferConsole.Mod/MewsiferConsole.exe` where `%WrathPath%` is the base game directory, `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Pathfinder Second Adventure` by default for Steam users.\n\nYou will be prompted to select a log source:\n\n![Startup screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/startup.png)\n\nSelect \"Connect to game\" to view logs for a currently active game instance. You can also start the game after starting the console.\n\nSelect \"Load from file\" to load a `*.mew` file created using the bug report API. See below for instructions on creating a bug report.\n\n**Important:** The console relies on a mod to send log events. MewsiferConsole.Mod needs to be enabled for it to function.\n\n### Filters\n\nFilter by text:\n\n![Text include screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/text_include.png)\n\nFilter by channel (use \"-\" to exclude):\n\n![Channel include screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/channel_include.png)\n![Channel exclude screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/channel_exclude.png)\n\nFilter by log level / severity:\n\n![Severity include screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/severity_include.png)\n![Severity exclude screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/severity_exclude.png)\n\nWhen combining filters a log is shown if it matches at least one include filter and *zero* exclude filters. For example, if your filter was `ch:Mews ch:Tabletop -sev:E -sev:V`:\n\n| Log Event                                       | Shown? | Why?                |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | :----: | ------------------- |\n| (I) [MewsiferConsole.Mod] Connected             | Yes    | Matching channel    |\n| (E) [MewsiferConsole.Mod] An exception occurred | No     | Severity excluded   |\n| (V) [MewsiferConsole.Mod] Sending message       | No     | Severity excluded   |\n| (I) [TabletopTweaks-Core] Adding                | Yes    | Matching channel    |\n| (I) [TabletopTweaks-Rework] Adding              | Yes    | Matching channel    |\n| (I) [System] Await                              | No     | No matching channel |\n\n### Log Level / Severity\n\nFor UMM logs:\n\n| Logging Method             | Severity  |\n| -------------------------- | :-------: |\n| `ModLogger.Log()`          | (I)nfo    |\n| `ModLogger.Warning()`      | (W)arning |\n| `ModLogger.Error()`        | (E)rror   |\n| `ModLogger.Critical()`     | (E)rror   |\n| `ModLogger.LogException()` | (E)rror   |\n| `ModLogger.NativeLog()`    | (V)erbose |\n\nFor Game logs:\n\n| Logging Method           | Severity  |\n| ------------------------ | :-------: |\n| `LogChannel.Log()`       | (I)nfo    |\n| `LogChannel.Verbose()`   | (I)nfo    |\n| `LogChannel.Warning()`   | (W)arning |\n| `LogChannel.Error()`     | (E)rror   |\n| `LogChannel.Exception()` | (E)rror   |\n\nNotably, Game logs do not support `Verbose`, so calls to `LogChannel.Verbose()` use the same severity as `LogChannel.Log()`.\n\n### Bug Report API\n\nIf you want to capture bug reports for your mod you can call `Mewsifer.GenerateReport(fileName)` ([Source](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/MewsiferConsole.Mod/Mewsifer.cs)):\n\n1. Add a reference to `MewsiferConsole.Mod.dll` to your project\n2. Call `Mewsifer.GenerateReport(fileName)` supplying the name of the resulting report\n3. Wait for the returned `Task` to complete\n    * The result contains the full file path\n4. Instruct the user to upload the resulting file to the appropriate location, or upload it automatically in your mod\n\nExample:\n\n```C#\n// Request in a new thread to prevent blocking the current thread from executing when Wait() is called\nnew Thread(new ThreadStart(LogReport)).Start();\n\nprivate static void LogReport()\n{\n  var report = Mewsifer.GenerateReport(\"MyModTestReport\");\n  report.Wait();\n  // Prints the report file path to the log\n  Logger.Log($\"Report generated: {report.Result}\");\n}\n```\n\nOnce you have the file you can open it by launching the console and selecting \"Load from file\" at startup.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* The modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat), an invaluable and supportive resource for help modding.\n* All the Owlcat modders who came before me, wrote documents, and open sourced their code.\n* Cyrix on Discord for the banner illustration used in MewsiferConsole.Menu\n\n## Interested in modding?\n\n* Check out the [OwlcatModdingWiki](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki).\n* Join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr).\n",

    "Description": "# MewsiferConsole\nAn improved remote console for reading logs in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous.\n\nFor reporting bugs to WotR mod devs, read [So you want to report a WotR mod bug?](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/ModBugReports.md)\n\n**Mod Developers: Add `MewsiferConsole.Mod` to `LoadAfter` in your `Info.json` to ensure all of your logs are captured.**\n\n```json\n\"LoadAfter\": [\"MewsiferConsole.Mod\"]\n```\n\n![Console screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/console.png)\n\n## Features\n\n* Captures Unity Mod Manager and Game logs\n* Filtering by Channel, Severity / Level, and text\n* De-dupe log events to reduce log spam\n* Bug report API to export a session which can be loaded into the console\n* Better performance than RemoteConsole\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (UMM), minimum version 0.23.0, and configure for use with Wrath\n2. Install [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) and use it to search for Mewsifer Console\n3. Click \"Install\"\n4. (Optional) Search for and install Mewsifer Console Menu and its dependency, [ModMenu]()\n    * Adds a button to the Mods menu which generates a bug report containing all logs from the current game session\n    * This is a great way to get bug reports from users\n\n![Menu options screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/menu.png)\n\nIf you don't want to use ModFinder you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/releases) and install normally using UMM.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installation run `%WrathPath%/Mods/MewsiferConsole.Mod/MewsiferConsole.exe` where `%WrathPath%` is the base game directory, `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Pathfinder Second Adventure` by default for Steam users.\n\nYou will be prompted to select a log source:\n\n![Startup screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/startup.png)\n\nSelect \"Connect to game\" to view logs for a currently active game instance. You can also start the game after starting the console.\n\nSelect \"Load from file\" to load a `*.mew` file created using the bug report API. See below for instructions on creating a bug report.\n\n**Important:** The console relies on a mod to send log events. MewsiferConsole.Mod needs to be enabled for it to function.\n\n### Filters\n\nFilter by text:\n\n![Text include screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/text_include.png)\n\nFilter by channel (use \"-\" to exclude):\n\n![Channel include screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/channel_include.png)\n![Channel exclude screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/channel_exclude.png)\n\nFilter by log level / severity:\n\n![Severity include screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/severity_include.png)\n![Severity exclude screenshot](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/screenshots/severity_exclude.png)\n\nWhen combining filters a log is shown if it matches at least one include filter and *zero* exclude filters. For example, if your filter was `ch:Mews ch:Tabletop -sev:E -sev:V`:\n\n| Log Event                                       | Shown? | Why?                |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | :----: | ------------------- |\n| (I) [MewsiferConsole.Mod] Connected             | Yes    | Matching channel    |\n| (E) [MewsiferConsole.Mod] An exception occurred | No     | Severity excluded   |\n| (V) [MewsiferConsole.Mod] Sending message       | No     | Severity excluded   |\n| (I) [TabletopTweaks-Core] Adding                | Yes    | Matching channel    |\n| (I) [TabletopTweaks-Rework] Adding              | Yes    | Matching channel    |\n| (I) [System] Await                              | No     | No matching channel |\n\n### Log Level / Severity\n\nFor UMM logs:\n\n| Logging Method             | Severity  |\n| -------------------------- | :-------: |\n| `ModLogger.Log()`          | (I)nfo    |\n| `ModLogger.Warning()`      | (W)arning |\n| `ModLogger.Error()`        | (E)rror   |\n| `ModLogger.Critical()`     | (E)rror   |\n| `ModLogger.LogException()` | (E)rror   |\n| `ModLogger.NativeLog()`    | (V)erbose |\n\nFor Game logs:\n\n| Logging Method           | Severity  |\n| ------------------------ | :-------: |\n| `LogChannel.Log()`       | (I)nfo    |\n| `LogChannel.Verbose()`   | (I)nfo    |\n| `LogChannel.Warning()`   | (W)arning |\n| `LogChannel.Error()`     | (E)rror   |\n| `LogChannel.Exception()` | (E)rror   |\n\nNotably, Game logs do not support `Verbose`, so calls to `LogChannel.Verbose()` use the same severity as `LogChannel.Log()`.\n\n### Bug Report API\n\nIf you want to capture bug reports for your mod you can call `Mewsifer.GenerateReport(fileName)` ([Source](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole/blob/main/MewsiferConsole.Mod/Mewsifer.cs)):\n\n1. Add a reference to `MewsiferConsole.Mod.dll` to your project\n2. Call `Mewsifer.GenerateReport(fileName)` supplying the name of the resulting report\n3. Wait for the returned `Task` to complete\n    * The result contains the full file path\n4. Instruct the user to upload the resulting file to the appropriate location, or upload it automatically in your mod\n\nExample:\n\n```C#\n// Request in a new thread to prevent blocking the current thread from executing when Wait() is called\nnew Thread(new ThreadStart(LogReport)).Start();\n\nprivate static void LogReport()\n{\n  var report = Mewsifer.GenerateReport(\"MyModTestReport\");\n  report.Wait();\n  // Prints the report file path to the log\n  Logger.Log($\"Report generated: {report.Result}\");\n}\n```\n\nOnce you have the file you can open it by launching the console and selecting \"Load from file\" at startup.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* The modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat), an invaluable and supportive resource for help modding.\n* All the Owlcat modders who came before me, wrote documents, and open sourced their code.\n* Cyrix on Discord for the banner illustration used in MewsiferConsole.Menu\n\n## Interested in modding?\n\n* Check out the [OwlcatModdingWiki](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki).\n* Join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr).\n",

Fiendish template for antipaladin animal companion and Armor Mastery/Shield Mastery feats that can be picked as Iron Tyrant bonus feats are used from TTT. If you don't have TTT-Base, mod will still work, just you will be missing additional possible selections. (No, I won't copypaste those in my mod, don't ask)\n\nWARNING: Alignment restrictions do not have mythic bypass clause. You stop being evil and you lose spellbook and active abilities. This is intended.\n\n#### Antipaladin exclusive companion and mount - Nightmare (flaming horse)\n\nSize: Large    \nSpeed: 50 ft.    \nAC: +8 natural armor    \nAttack: bite (1d4), 2 hooves (1d6)    \nAbility scores: Str 18, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 13, Wis 13, Cha 12     \nSpecial qualities: Hoof attacks deal additional 1d4 fire damage.    \nNightmares are not animals, but evil outsiders and thus are not affected by abilities targeting specifically animals or not working on outsiders. That means Animal Growth and Legendary Proporions do NOT work on them. \n\nThey do not have any special level where they get upgrade. They receive the usual bonuses from animal level ups.\n\nCan be mounted with character properly (mostly) sitting on the mount. Occasionally it will be wonky, accept it as what it is.\n\nBardings can be equipped (provided you have proficiency), but they will not show on the model.\n\nThey use Horse portrait.\n\n### New feats\n\n- [Unsanctioned Knowledge (paladin and antipaladin versions)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/unsanctioned-knowledge/)\n- Snake style feat chain\n\t- [Snake Style](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/snake-style-combat-style)\n\t- [Snake Sidewind](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/snake-sidewind-combat)\n\t- [Snake Fang](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/snake-fang-combat)\n- Startoss style feat chain\n\t- [Startoss Style](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/startoss-style-combat-style)\n\t- [Startoss Comet](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/startoss-comet-combat)\n\t- [Startoss Shower](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/startoss-shower-combat)\n- Dimensional Savant feat chain\n    - [Dimensional Agility](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/dimensional-agility)\n\t- [Dimensional Assault](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/dimensional-assault)\n\t- [Dimensional Dervish](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/dimensional-dervish)\n- [Flickering Step](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/conduit-feats/flickering-step-conduit)\n- [Crusader's Flurry](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/crusader-s-flurry)\n### New spells\n\n- [Deadly Juggernaut (Cleric 3, Inquisitor 3, Paladin 3, Antipaladin 3, Warpriest 3)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/deadly-juggernaut/)   \n- [Blade of Dark Triumph (Antipaladin 3)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blade-of-dark-triumph)\n- [Blade of Bright Victory (Paladin 3)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blade-of-bright-victory)\n- [Widen Auras (Antipaladin 2)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/widen-auras/) - note, only Antipaladin, no Paladin version.\n\n### New Ki powers\n- [Ki Power: Deadly Juggernaut](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Monk/archetypes/paizo-monk-archetypes/qinggong-monk/#8th-Level_Ki_Powers)\n- [Ki Power: Ki Leech](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Monk/archetypes/paizo-monk-archetypes/qinggong-monk/#10th-Level_Ki_Powers)\n\n### New class features\n- [Druidic Herbalism](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-classes/druid/#Nature_Bond_Ex)\nFor simplicity of implementation and usage nerfed compared to tabletop description:   \n  Instead of free WIS mod concoctions every day, druid gets to brew any potion for free.\n- [Legion's Blessing (Cleric Crusader archetype lvl 8 feature)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/archetypes/paizo-cleric-archetypes/crusader)\nAllows you to sacrifice spell slot (through spontaneous conversion), making your next spell of exactly 3 levels lower with a range of touch to be applied to all allies in a 10 ft radius.\n\t- properly takes into account metamagic and stuff\n\t- effects that trigger \"on spell cast\" will trigger for each target, which may be desired or not.\n\t- will work on modded spells or spells added through Loremaster.

This was 'fixed' by Owlcat at some point so now extra natural \nattacks give no benefit to PCs. With this enabled, vanilla behaviour is replaced with an approximation\nof the tabletop rules:\n\nAddtional natural attacks of the same kind gives a stacking increase to the effective size of the 'weapon'\n(eg. 2 pairs of Medium claw attacks effectively grant 1 pair of Large claw attacks instead).\n\nYou get all 'enchantment' effects (elemental damage/DR penetration/etc.) but multiple enchants of the same type\ndo not stack.\n\n### Major Strength Blessing Armor Speed Fix\n\nWarpriest's Major Blessing for Strength domain now applies to heavy armor in addition to medium\narmor - now matches its description.\n\n### Force Book of Dreams Upgrade\n\nThe Book of Dreams item is supposed to upgrade at certain points in the story,\nbut this has never reliably worked (at least in my experience). Enabling this forces the \nupgrade script to run on every Etude update. Disabled by default.\n\n### Identify natural weapons\n\nIn some cases, \"enchanted\" natural weapons will appear as Unidentified, requiring a Knowledge (Arcana) check\nto identify. This force identifies natural weapons on equip\n\n(This was already included in previous versions of the mod and enabled at all times,\nbut has now been given its own setting)\n\n### Fix empty hand weapon equip\n\nWhen multiple features or buffs grant \"empty hand replacement\" weapons (eg. claws) the game is supposed to equip the \"best\" set\nbut sometimes it just chooses the newest (which may be worse than the claws they're replacing).\nThis adds an additional check after equip to try to ensure the \"best\" weapon was selected.\n\n### Reformed Fiend DR/good\n\nChanges the damage reduction for the Reformed Fiend Bloodrage archetype from DR/evil to DR/good.\nDisabled by default.\n\n### Dollroom postprocessing filter toggles\n\nAllows you to disable some postprocess filters in the dollroom (inventory screen, character creation. mythic level up, etc.)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* Special thanks to the modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr) - in particular, Pheonix99 and Bubbles.\n* WittleWolfie for ModMenu\n",

    "Description": "# ModMenu\n\nAdds a new page to the game options for mods. This allows mods to easily implement settings using native UI instead of UMM. This does not create a save dependency.\n\n![Test settings screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/test_settings.png)\n\n![More settings screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/more_settings.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (UMM), minimum version 0.23.0, and configure for use with Wrath\n2. Install [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) and use it to search for Mewsifer Console\n3. Click \"Install\"\n\nIf you don't want to use ModFinder you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases/latest) and install normally using UMM.\n\n## Problems or Suggestions\n\nFile an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/issues/new) or reach out to me (@WittleWolfie) on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr) in #mod-dev-technical or #mod-user-general channel.\n\n### Controller Support\n\n**This does not support controllers**. It's a lot of work to support, but let me know if you need this. If there is enough demand I will add it.\n\n## Mods Using ModMenu\n\nThis is a non-exhaustive list, let me know if you want your mod added here!\n\n* [Added Feats](https://github.com/Telyl/AddedFeats)\n* [BOAT BOAT BOAT](https://github.com/Balkoth-dev/WOTR_BOAT_BOAT_BOAT)\n* [Character Options+](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus)\n* [MewsiferConsole](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole)\n\n## Mod Developers\n\n### Why should you use it?\n\n* It looks nice!\n* Automatically persists your settings\n* Handles restoring defaults\n* Automatically persists per-save settings\n* Super easy to use\n\n### How to use it\n\nThe screenshot above was generated using [TestSettings](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/ModMenu/Settings/TestSettings.cs). That exercises every function supported. The API is documented and generally self-explanatory.\n\nIn your mod's `Info.json` add `ModMenu` as a requirement:\n\n```json\n\"Requirements\": [\"ModMenu\"]\n```\n\nYou should specify a minimum version:\n\n```json\n\"Requirements\": [\"ModMenu-1.1.0\"]\n```\n\nIt's safest to just specify the version you build against as the minimum version, but methods added after 1.0 do specify the version in their remarks.\n\nInstall ModMenu then in your mod's project add `%WrathPath%/Mods/ModMenu/ModMenu.dll` as an assembly reference.\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nCreate a setting:\n\n```C#\nModMenu.AddSettings(\n  SettingsBuilder.New(\"mymod-settings, SettingsTitle)\n    .AddToggle(Toggle.New(\"mymod-settings-toggle\", defaultValue: true, MyToggleTitle)\n      .OnValueChanged(OnToggle)));\n      \nprivate static void OnToggle(bool toggleValue) {\n  // The user just changed the toggle, toggleValue is the new setting.\n  // If you need to react to it changing then you can do that here.\n  // If you don't need to do something whenever the value changes, you can skip OnValueChanged()\n}\n```\n\nGet the setting value:\n\n```C#\nModMenu.GetSettingValue<bool>(\"mymod-settings-toggle\");\n```\n\n**The game handles the setting value for you.** You do not need to save the setting, or set the setting to a specific value. You *can* set it if necessary but most of the time it isn't necessary. This includes saving settings that you flag as per-save using `DependsOnSave()`.\n\nFor more examples see [TestSettings](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/ModMenu/Settings/TestSettings.cs).\n\n### Best Practices\n\n* **Do not add settings during mod load,** without additional handling you cannot create a `LocalizedString`. I recommend adding settings before, during, or after `BlueprintsCache.Init()`.\n* Don't use `IsModificationAllowed` to enable/disable a setting based on another setting. This is checked when the page is opened so it won't apply immediately.\n* Indicate settings which require reboot using `WithLongDescription()`. The game's setting boolean `RequireReboot` does nothing.\n\nDefine a \"root\" key unique to your mod to make sure there are no key conflicts:\n\n```C#\nprivate const string RootKey = \"mymod-settings\";\n```\n\nYou can then prepend this to all of your settings keys:\n\n```C#\n\n// Results in a settings key \"mymod-settings-key\"\nvar toggle = Toggle.New(GetKey(\"toggle\"), MyToggleTitle);\n\nprivate static string GetKey(string key)\n{\n  return $\"{RootKey}-{key}\";\n}\n```\n\nJust make sure you always get the key the same way when getting a setting value.\n\n### Settings Behavior\n\n* Settings with `DependsOnSave()` are associated with a save slot, but do not create save dependencies\n    * You do not need to handle saving or restoring settings at all, though save dependent settings may be lost if the mod is disabled\n* `OnValueChanged()` is called after the user clicks \"Apply\" and confirms\n* `OnTempValueChanged()` is called immediately after the user changes the value, but before it is applied\n* A setting's value can be checked at any time by calling [GetSettingValue()](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/ModMenu/ModMenu.cs#L85)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* A shout out to Bubbles (factsubio) who essentially wrote the new image and button settings types when I was about to give up.\n* The modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr), an invaluable and supportive resource for help modding.\n* All the Owlcat modders who came before me, wrote documents, and open sourced their code.\n\n## Interested in modding?\n\n* Check out the [OwlcatModdingWiki](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki).\n* Join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr).\n",

    "Description": "# Mythic Path Power Swapper mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous\n\nAllows changing mythic powers to powers from another path, or playing without mythic powers at all.\n\n## Download\n\nI recommend using [Modfinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases) to download WotR mods. \n\nBut if you don't want to, here are the links for manual download:  \n\nFirst get [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases) if you don't have it\n\nNow download this mod: [**LINK**](https://github.com/alterasc/MythicPathPowerSwapper/releases/latest)\n\n## How to install:\n\n1. Use Unity Mod Manager.\n2. Install ModMenu.\n3. Install this mod.\n4. Set settings to your liking.\n5. Restart to apply them.\n## Functionality\n\nDoes NOT introduce save dependency, so safe to remove mid-game. Just do respec and things should mostly (see notes below) return to normal.\nAffects ALL saves globally.\n\n**SETTING CHANGES APPLY ONLY AFTER RESTART**\n\nHow to use: \nChoose which mythic path to change.\nChoose how to change.\n\n\nLegendarify option remove mythic powers and spellbook, grants rising bonus to all stats and modifies XP table so you get levels earlier. See section later.\n\nOption \"remove path powers\" makes your progression like your companions. \"Remove all powers\" removes everything. You still has mythic rank, but no abilities.\n\nSo for example if you pick Demon in first selection and Lich in second, your Demon will have Lich powers and Lich spellbook.\n\nNote on \"Add Aivu\":  \nThis adds Aivu to the selected mythic path (regardless of what you're copying from). I don't know what that will do. You wil have her, but will she talk, get recognized, break quests or your whole game - no clue. It's just a setting that took me 20 minutes to add, so I did because I can. If you try it, feel free to tell me how things went for you.\n\nOptions to demythic mythic hero and companions can be enabled without changes to your path powers.\n\n## Notes\n- Affects ALL saves. Because it does not create new blueprints (for save safety ) it changes existing. As unfortunate side effect of this if you set for example Lich have Aeon powers, that changes some Aeon powers to rely on Lich Mythic class, meaning some Aeon powers will not work correctly when you're an Aeon until you reset the power swap or remove the mod.\n- Affects things that are defined in mythic class progression. If you see it on mythic page - it's will be affected.   \n- You will get spellbook from the class that you copy from.    \n- You will receive Artifact Cloak of your original path, but enchantment will be swapped to the copied path.   \n- Story will proceed as your original path, there will be no recognition of \"wrong\" powers.    \n- If you're on Azata path you get Aivu as normal, because she's important to the story.   \n- If you copy from Azata, you by default do not gain Aivu, unless you toggle \"Add Aivu\" to On.\n\n- Azata receives spells depending on sub-path. So if you copy from Azata you don't get them. My advice - use TTT-Reworks, it adds those spells anyway.\n\n- Late game paths are unchanged. If you swap to Devil with changed progression I have no idea what will happen. Probably nothing, but it's on you.\nChanging to other late game paths that remove your old path abilities should work as usual.\n\n## Legendarify\n- Removes mythic powers\n- On ranks 3-5-7-9 you get stacking +1 bonus to all stats (total +4 to all stats at MR9)\n- With each mythic rank XP table gets shorter and shorter. At M3-M4 you can expect to be 1-2 levels higher than normal, at M5-M6 3-5 levels higher. At M9 progression is almost like normal legend, but to get to level 40 you need more experience than normal Legend. But you still will get lvl 40 eventually, just somewhat later. For comparison normal legend lvl 40 = legendarified lvl 38.\n- If you swap to late game non-Legend path, you get to keep your levels over 20. As far as I'm concerned this is your responsibility.\n- Exact XP table is at the bottom of readme.\n- You also get hidden legend feature that removes path visual changes.\n\n## Troubleshooting\nUnless you enabled \"Add Aivu\", turning mod off and doing respec will solve all your problems.\nIf you used \"Add Aivu\" maybe respec will help. Maybe not.\n\n## Compatibility with mods\nMaybe?   \nDepends on what and how they do things. \nIs mostly compatible with TTT at least, that I checked.\nI've tried to set priorities so it loads also after Path of Rage and Spellbook Merge, so maybe their changes are forwarded.\n\n\n## More spellbook merge? \nNO.  \nNot touching it.\n\n## Can I have multiple paths?  \nOut of scope for this mod.\n\n\n## Appendix\n\n### XP Tables\n\nNormal is normal XP table   \nLegend is Legend XP table   \nM3 - M9 is how your table changes over the course of mythic ranks.  \n\n| Level | Normal | M3 | M4 | M5 | M6 | M7 | M8 | M9 | Legend |   \n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |   \n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n| 2 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000 | 2000\n| 3 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000 | 5000\n| 4 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000 | 9000\n| 5 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000 | 15000\n| 6 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000 | 23000\n| 7 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000 | 35000\n| 8 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000 | 51000\n| 9 | 75000 | 69000 | 67000 | 66000 | 64000 | 62000 | 61000 | 59000 | 55000\n| 10 | 105000 | 94000 | 89000 | 85000 | 80000 | 77000 | 73000 | 69000 | 62000\n| 11 | 155000 | 125000 | 120000 | 110000 | 100000 | 94000 | 87000 | 81000 | 68000\n| 12 | 220000 | 170000 | 155000 | 140000 | 125000 | 115000 | 105000 | 94000 | 75000\n| 13 | 315000 | 235000 | 205000 | 180000 | 160000 | 140000 | 125000 | 110000 | 85000\n| 14 | 445000 | 315000 | 270000 | 235000 | 200000 | 170000 | 150000 | 125000 | 96000\n| 15 | 635000 | 430000 | 360000 | 300000 | 250000 | 210000 | 175000 | 150000 | 105000\n| 16 | 890000 | 580000 | 475000 | 385000 | 315000 | 260000 | 210000 | 170000 | 115000\n| 17 | 1300000 | 785000 | 625000 | 500000 | 395000 | 315000 | 250000 | 200000 | 130000\n| 18 | 1800000 | 1050000 | 830000 | 645000 | 500000 | 390000 | 300000 | 235000 | 155000\n| 19 | 2550000 | 1450000 | 1100000 | 830000 | 625000 | 475000 | 360000 | 270000 | 180000\n| 20 | 3600000 | 1950000 | 1450000 | 1050000 | 790000 | 580000 | 430000 | 315000 | 200000\n| 21 |  | 2650000 | 1900000 | 1400000 | 990000 | 710000 | 515000 | 370000 | 220000\n| 22 |  | 3600000 | 2550000 | 1750000 | 1250000 | 875000 | 610000 | 430000 | 260000\n| 23 |  | 4900000 | 3350000 | 2300000 | 1550000 | 1050000 | 730000 | 500000 | 280000\n| 24 |  | 6600000 | 4400000 | 2950000 | 1950000 | 1300000 | 875000 | 580000 | 315000\n| 25 |  | 8950000 | 5850000 | 3800000 | 2450000 | 1600000 | 1050000 | 680000 | 370000\n| 26 |  | 12000000 | 7700000 | 4900000 | 3100000 | 1950000 | 1250000 | 790000 | 445000\n| 27 |  | 16500000 | 10000000 | 6300000 | 3900000 | 2400000 | 1500000 | 920000 | 500000\n| 28 |  | 22500000 | 13500000 | 8100000 | 4900000 | 2950000 | 1800000 | 1050000 | 635000\n| 29 |  | 30500000 | 18000000 | 10500000 | 6150000 | 3600000 | 2100000 | 1250000 | 720000\n| 30 |  | 41000000 | 23500000 | 13500000 | 7700000 | 4400000 | 2550000 | 1450000 | 890000\n| 31 |  | 55500000 | 31000000 | 17500000 | 9700000 | 5400000 | 3000000 | 1700000 | 1000000\n| 32 |  | 75500000 | 41000000 | 22500000 | 12000000 | 6650000 | 3600000 | 1950000 | 1300000\n| 33 |  | 100000000 | 54000000 | 29000000 | 15500000 | 8100000 | 4300000 | 2300000 | 1550000\n| 34 |  | 140000000 | 71500000 | 37000000 | 19000000 | 9950000 | 5150000 | 2650000 | 1800000\n| 35 |  | 190000000 | 94500000 | 48000000 | 24000000 | 12000000 | 6150000 | 3100000 | 2000000\n| 36 |  | 255000000 | 125000000 | 61500000 | 30500000 | 15000000 | 7350000 | 3600000 | 2550000\n| 37 |  | 345000000 | 165000000 | 79500000 | 38000000 | 18500000 | 8750000 | 4200000 | 3000000\n| 38 |  | 465000000 | 220000000 | 100000000 | 48000000 | 22500000 | 10500000 | 4900000 | 3600000\n| 39 |  | 635000000 | 290000000 | 130000000 | 60000000 | 27500000 | 12500000 | 5700000 | 4050000\n| 40 |  | 860000000 | 380000000 | 170000000 | 75500000 | 33500000 | 15000000 | 6650000 | 4700000\n",

Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 3 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab\n```\n## Changes\n```\n* Includes a number of changes to Demon Rage. This is now a toggleable ability that will consume a number of rounds instead of per-combat and a new icon is added.\n* When you gain your Demon path, new special abilites called Demonologies are unlocked, allowing more rounds of rage per day.\n* Brimorak Aspect uses a new component to fix its expected scaling.\n* Succubus Aspect now properly gives a malus to Attack Bonus instead of AC.\n* Kalvakus Aspect's bonus attack will only work while you have a melee weapon.\n* Shadow Demon Aspect will no longer give double the wisdom bonus when toggled.\n* Adds new icons to each aspect making it easier to tell them apart.\n* Allows you to toggle Barbarian and Bloodrager rages while in a demon rage.\n* Abyssal Storm no longer hurts the caster.\n* Blood Haze now gives a +2 profane bonus to attack.\n* At Mythic Rank 4 you gain an ability to use Demonic Charge that isn't a teleport. This is for instances where you can't use Demonic Charge\n* As a Major demonic aspect you can select Lilithu, gaining a bonus to your Charisma as well as allowing all your spells and spell-like abilites to be considered using Selective Metamagic.\n* As a Major demonic aspect you can select Oolioddroo, gaining a bonus to your Dexterity and allowing all attacks to be rolled twice and take the highest result.\n* Fixes Demonic Aura so that it will only apply its damage when an enemy starts a new round instead of every time you activate Bloodrage.\n* Fixes autometamagic so that it will work on spells that are not originally part of a spellbook but added later. This is important for Arcane Bloodline for Bloodragers.\n* Adds a new mythic ability called Mighty Demonrage. This allows you to cast a demon spell of fourth level or lower as a swift action while Demon Raging.\n* Nocticula Aspect will now work with both Lilithu and Oolioddroo major aspects.\n* Nocticula Aspect has a better icon so you don't lose it with all the other abilities.\n* Nocticula Aspect is restricted to once per combat.\n* Nocticula Aspect is will give bloodrager and barbarian rages if you have them.\n* Legendary Proportions no longer changes your size to Huge. This is because it conflicts with Abyssal Bulk from Bloodragers, and it's not tabletop compliant.\n* Added compatibility with TTT-Base and the Brimorak Aspect Fix. If TTT-Base is installed and has its brimorak aspect setting active, then the setting on Path of Rage will turn off.\n* Added a toggle that will disable Dark Codex's limitless rage affecting Demon Rage. This only affects the new Demon Rage.\n* Demon Rage now updated. You will be able to use it now for an unlimited amount of time out of combat. This also means it will not turn off when combat ends, meaning you get to stay angry even between cutscenes!\n* Elemental Rampager is now activated when you start your demonic rage.\n* Balor Aspect should no longer give its intelligence bonus.\n* Fixed bug with demon rage that causes it to persist when given as part of a cutscene.\n```\n## Current New Abilities\n![alt text](https://github.com/Balkoth-dev/WOTR_PATH_OF_RAGE/blob/master/PathOfRageDemonologies.png?raw=true)\n## Change Log\n```\n03/26/2023\n* Allows Demonic Charge to target a point instead of a unit.\n03/15/2023\n* Hotfix for Demon Rend and non-shapeshifted polymorph spells.\n03/14/2023\n* Added a toggle that will disable Dark Codex's limitless rage affecting Demon Rage.

You will be able to use it now for an unlimited amount of time out of combat.

If TTT-Base is installed and has its brimorak aspect setting active, then the setting on Path of Rage will turn off.\n* Made the new demon rage no longer work with Dark Codex's infinite rage resource.\n03/21/2022\n* Carnage Incarnate's vulnerability removed\n* Carnage Incarnate's debuff will now deal 1d6 damage whenever attacked with a weapon.\n* Carnage Incarnate's explosion radius increased from 5 feet to 10 feet.\n* DEMONIC SMASH's radius increased from 5 feet to 10 feet.\n03/11/2022\n* Nocticula Aspect will now work with both Lilithu and Quasit major aspects.\n* Nocticula Aspect has a better icon so you don't lose it with all the other abilities.\n* Nocticula Aspect is restricted to once per combat.\n* Nocticula Aspect is will give bloodrager and barbarian rages if you have them.\n* Legendary Proportions no longer changes your size to Huge.

This is because Enduring Spells no longer works on abilities.\n* Aspect of Lilithu has been added. This gives you a Charisma bonus as well as allowing all your spells and spell-like abilites to be considered using Selective Metamagic.\n* Aspect of Quasit has been added. This gives you a Dexterity bonus and allows all attacks to be rolled twice and take the highest result.\n* BlueprintCore has been stripped down to the bare essentials to what this mod needs to hopefully make it easier to survive updates in the future.\n01/09/2022\n* Fixed text on Demon Rage to correctly state that it starts at 12 rounds instead of 18\n* Demon Blast correctly is now given at rank 4 instead of rank 3\n11/25/2021\n* Fixed Demon Rage so that it no longer stays if triggered in a cutscene\n* Updated Unleashed Demon so that you may polymorph into a Sin Guzzler at Rank 9 at will for 24 hours.\n\n```\n\n## Special Thanks\nThanks to @Vek17#1898, @bubbles#0538, @kadyn#6364, @WittleWolfie#8477, and everyone else on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/owlcat).

    "Description": "# Prestige Plus v2.1.2 for WoTR \n## Requirements: [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu). [TTT-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core).\n\n- This mod adds a lot of character options to the game, especially combat maneuvers and prestige classes!\n- All features are toggleable.\n\n## Featuring\n\n### Combat Maneuver+\n- You can Disarm, Sunder, or Trip in lieu of a melee attack, and Bull Rush in lieu of a charge attack, like on tabletop!\n- [Seize the Opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/path-of-war/feats/seize-the-opportunity-combat/): From Path of War\n- Kinda OP so you can make it a mythic feat instead of combat feat if you like (default off)\n- [Surprise Maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/surprise-maneuver/)\n- [Strength Surge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo-rage-powers/strength-surge-ex/)\n- [Ki Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/ki-throw-combat/) and its mythic feat!\n- [Improved Ki Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-ki-throw-combat/)\n- [Binding Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/binding-throw-combat/)\n- [Enhanced Ki Throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/enhanced-ki-throw-combat/)\n### [Grapple Mechanic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#Grapple)\n- This is how I implement it:\n1. There are 3 kinds of grapples in the game. My Grapple Mechanic is very close to tabletop. Shifter grapples stay owlcat-brew but once the shifter takes Grapple (Improved Grapple) feat, their grapple mechanics would be turned into mine. Finally, monster grapples stay the way it is in vanilla.\n2. If you are grappled, you can attempt to break the grapple by making a combat maneuver check (DC equal to your opponent’s CMD; this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) or Thievery check (with a DC equal to your opponent’s CMD). If you succeed, you break the grapple as a standard action. However, if you fail nothing happens, you don't use your standard action.\n3. Tied Up creatures still need to be grappled. The rope would be bursted if you release grapple, because you don't have time to tie someone up properly in combat. They are not helpless but can become the target of Coup De Grace. Additionally, grapple actions against them auto-succeed, they're auto pinned by the rope and their Thievery check DC to escape is higher.\n- Added Feats: Grapple (Improved Grapple), Greater Grapple, Rapid Grappler, Unfair Grip, Pinning Knockout, Pinning Rend, Savage Slam, Dramatic Slam, Hamatula Strike, Throat Slicer\n- Added Mythic Feats and Abilities (inspired by tabletop abilities of the same name): Grapple (Mythic), Uncanny Grapple, Aerial Assault, Knot Expert, Meat Shield, Maneuver Expert\n- Added Familiar: Crab King\n- Added Alchemist Discovery: Tentacle\n### [Deific Obedience](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/deific-obedience)\n- [Ragathiel](https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ragathiel): requires worshipping Ragathiel (Expanded Content) or Lawful Good\n- [Shelyn (sentinel)](https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shelyn): requires worshipping Shelyn or Neutral Good\n- [Naderi (sentinel)](https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Naderi): requires worshipping Naderi (Expanded Content) or Neutral\n- [Dsena](https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Desna): requires worshipping Desna or Chaotic Good\n- [Erastil](https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Erastil): requires worshipping Erastil or Lawful Good\n- [Gorum (sentinel)](https://www.aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Gorum): requires worshipping Gorum or Chaotic Neutral\n- More coming soon!\n### [Sentinel](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/s-z/sentinel/)\n- [Guided Hand](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/guided-hand/)\n- [Guided Hand (Mythic)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic/mythic-feats/guided-hand-mythic/)\n- The favored weapon is determined by your actual deity, not the deity of your obedience.\n- It works for deities from other mods!\n### [Agent of the Grave Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/a-b/agent-of-the-grave/)\n- The class has only 5 levels.\n- Agent of the Grave lose spell progression at level 1. I have no idea why my code can make you lose spell progression, but it just works.\n- Hide your alignment!\n#### Homebrew Options:  \n- At level 5 you can learn all necromancy spells (requires 13 int, full caster)\n- Or become a ghoul! (you're undead so incompatible with lichdom)\n- Or become a vampire! (requires blood drinker, incompatible with lichdom)\n### [Anchorite of Dawn Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/a-b/anchorite/)\n- Focused Sacred Weapon can't be turned off once chosen (it will become very complicated for me otherwise)\n- Credence gives access to [Dervish in TTT](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base).\n#### Homebrew Options:  \n- Blossoming Light: a mythic ability to use Solar Invocation for free!\n### [Arcane Archer Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/core-rulebook/arcane-archer/)   \n- A True Imbue Arrow is always with a quickened spell XD\n- And we have [Deadeye Devotee](https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Arcane%20Archer%20Deadeye%20Devotee)!\n#### Homebrew Options:  \n- Storm of Arrows: a mythic ability to increase the number of uses of Hail of Arrows!\n### [Asavir Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/a-b/asavir/)   \n- Share your pet with Djinni’s Blessing!\n- Gain Cavalier Mobility if TTT-base installed.\n- Trample (Mythic): a mythic feat inspired by tabletop abilities of the same name! (notice that owlcat trample works differently from tabletop)\n#### Homebrew Options:  \n- Bond of Genies: a mythic ability to mount any party member!\n### [Chevalier Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/c-d/chevalier/)\n- The class has only 3 levels.\n### [Crimson Templar Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/c-d/crimson-templar/)\n- Requires worshipping Ragathiel (Expanded Content) or Lawful Good.\n### [Esoteric Knight Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/e-h/esoteric-knight/)\n#### Homebrew Options:  \n- Dvine Psychic: continue divine spellcasting progression every 2 levels!\n- Kinetic Esoterica: more versatile kineticist progression!\n### [Furious Guardian Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/e-h/furious-guardian/)\n- Chosen Ally is for babarian standard rage only =-=\n### [Halfling Opportunist Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/e-h/halfling-opportunist/)\n#### Homebrew Options:  \n- Alternative access to the class for non-halflings!\n- A mythic feat to use another combat maneuver with Exploitive Maneuver.\n### [Horizon Walker Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/apg/horizon-walker/)\n- The Terrain Mastery abilities of Astral Plane and Abyss are actually useless in the module but they are prerequisites for their Terrain Dominance.\n- There isn't a GM available telling which creature is native to where, so ONLY ABYSS's favored enemy bonus works, for demons (which is written explicitly in the its description). And you guys probably won't focus on other creatures anyway lol\n### [Hinterlander Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/e-h/hinterlander/)\n- Master Archer gives access to [Deadeye’s Blessing in TTT](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base) and [Pinpoint Targeting in ExpandedContent](https://github.com/ka-dyn/ExpandedContent), but you'll need the respective mod active to select them. If you don't want these feats, my mod doesn't require anything, as the original feature will still be there.\n- Gain a new Favored Terrain at level 2, 6, and an upgrade at level 9, 10. No need to study for 24 hours!\n### [Inheritor’s Crusader Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/i-m/inheritor-s-crusader/)\n- The class has only 3 levels.\n#### Homebrew Options:  \n- Spells per day/Destroyer of Tyranny/Sword Against Injustice: Now warpriest-friendly!\n### [Mammoth Rider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/i-m/mammoth-rider/)\n- Gigantic Steed gives stackable bonus instead of size bonus. It just doesn't make any sense that this can't stack with magical enlarge effect!\n- Steed’s Reach is togglable, because longer reach might have negative impact in the game.\n#### Homebrew Options:  \n- Gigantic Assault: a mythic ability to charge like a beast!\n### [Sanguine Angel Class (Lite)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/s-z/sanguine-angel/)\n- Requires [Dark Codex](https://github.com/Truinto/DarkCodex), or you won't gain Prodigious Two-Weapon Fighting.\n- The class has 10 levels, but I only implement the first 3 levels because it doesn't have good stuff at higher levels.\n#### Homebrew Options:  \n- Become an Angel of Death early! (requires precise shot)\n- Feat: Extra Tyrant’s Discipline\n### [Scar Seeker Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/s-z/scar-seeker/)   \n- Gain spell progression at level 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.\n### [Shadowdancer Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/core-rulebook/shadowdancer/)   \n#### Homebrew Options:  \n- Summon Shadow: You can choose an animal companian instead and make it undead!\n- Shadow Jump: You can choose any feat from the dimentional feat chain instead! This requires [Microscopic Content Expansion mod](https://github.com/alterasc/MicroscopicContentExpansion/). If you don't want these feats, my mod doesn't require anything, as the original feature will still be there.\n- Extra Shadow Jump: This is a homebrew feat that gives you 4 extra uses of Shadow Jump ability and you can take it as soon as shadowdancer level 1!\n### [Umbral Agent Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/s-z/umbral-agent/)   \n#### Homebrew Options:  \n- Endless Gaze: a mythic ability to use Unnerving Gaze for free!\n- Shadow Jump: You can choose any feat from the dimentional feat chain instead!

At 10th assassin level, it becomes a move action.\n- Greater Swift Death: Your Death Attack becomes a move action. At 10th assassin level, it becomes a swift action.\n- Unbreakable Defense: You no longer have a limited amount of Defensive Stance rounds per day.\n- Draconic Wings: The disciple gains two primary wing attacks that deal 1d4 damage.\n- Endless Breath: You have 1/3 chance to recover one use of your breath weapon at the start of your turn.

Additionally, his sneak attack no longer deals precision damage.\n- Mystic Catalyst: You can use Lesser Spell Synthesis ability at will.\n### Other Features\n\n- Estimated THC: Show hit chance and spell (not) saved chance in turn based mode. This is not precise because it doesn't take into consideration certain effects such as concealment, spell penetration or conditional save bonus, but still better than nothing, eh? (default off)\n- Infernal Healing: You can fully heal outside of combat by spending gold, as if you buy a wand of infernal healing and use it! (gold : hp = 3:2)\n- Weak Crits against Enemies: Symmetrical with owlcat weak crits settings, making it fair (default off)\n- Fix Difficulty CMD Tripple-Dipped: This will significantly reduce enemy CMD at higher difficulties. CMD is calculated by adding STR bonus, DEX bonus and AC bonus, which means difficulty stat advancement is applied 3 times in vanilla, leading to total madness.\n\n## Mod Combo\n\n### [Expanded Content](https://github.com/ka-dyn/ExpandedContent)\n- Thanks bitter for adding [aid another](https://www.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Aid%20Another&Category=Special%20Attacks) related stuff to my Asavir and Halfling Opportunist!\n### [Holy Vindicator](https://github.com/SpencerMycek/WoTR-HolyVindicator)\n- Spellbook Progression - Fixed\n- Divine Wrath, Divine Judgment, Divine Retribution!\n\n## Thanks to  \n-   WittleWolfie for his [Blueprint-Core](https://wittlewolfie.github.io/WW-Blueprint-Core/index.html), which makes modding easy and enjoyable.\n-   Bubbles (factsubio) for BubblePrints, saving me from going mad.   \n-   All the Owlcat modders who came before me, wrote documents, and open sourced their code.\n-   Pathfinder Wrath of The Righteous Discord channel members.\n-   Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr)\n",

    "Description": "## Random Equipment 2\n\n [WrathModMaker](https://github.com/cabarius/WrathModMaker) is required to build.\n [ModMenu 1.3.1+](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases) is required to build and required to play.\n\n This a mod for Pathfinder: WOTR that will add random game loot to any container the player interacts with based on a percentage chance. The loot already inside the container is untouched by the mod and will only add to it. The loot possible is based on your level and shouldn't give anything inappropriately OP.\n\n This is the second version of Random Equipment. The entire mod has been rewritten from the ground up. While not a whole lot has changed on the front end\n lots have changed on the back end of things. This opens up a options for user customizations in the future.  This mod is save safe and can be installed \n during a playthrough or removed. It will break nothing.\n \n Updates include:\n * New settings menu using WittleWolfie's [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases). The lets you customize your random item experience!\n\tEach type of container can have it's own chances of containing loot and the level modifiers that get applied.\n * Containers can now add some usables to the container for a little extra spice.\n * Option to see your roll each time you open that container. Rolls use the base dice system from the game so no blaming me for your bad luck!\n\n Settings (found under the games settings menu under the tab Mods:\n * There are 3 sections:\n\t* Standard: These are the settings for  normal every day container you find\n\t* Hidden: These are the settings for containers you require a perception check to find\n\t* Locked: These are the settings for containers that are locked.\n * Chance of Random Loot\n\t* This setting is the base chance that there is random loot in the container. If you miss this check you get nothing.\n * Chance of Random Usables\n\t* This setting is the chance that a container contains random usables in addition to whatever else is in the chest.\n * Minimum/Maximum Level Modifier\n\t* These settings determine the range of the modifiers applied to the CR/CL of the loot in the container. If you get lucky your loot might be a level or two\n\t  higher than your current level or the reverse if you are unlucky. The default settings mostly have the extreme ends at a lower chance of being rolled than\n\t  the middle of the range (bell curve). The approximate chances of getting any specific modifier is listed in the description. \n * Random Modifier Curve Shift\n\t* This setting will adjust were the middle of the bell curve mentioned above sits. Increasing it will make the Maximum modified side more likely to be rolled.\n\t  Decreasing it will move the chances closer to the Minimum Modifier side of the curve.\n * Random Modifier Curve Scale\n\t* This setting will adjust the peak of the curve. Increasing the scale will make all the numbers in the range move closer to being similar in the chances to roll.\n\t  Decreasing will make the middle of the range much more likely to be rolled making the ends of the range less likely. I suggest playing around with the sliders\n\t  to see how the effect the chances and select one that you would most want to see in your game.\n * Logging\n   \t* Verbose logging (off by default): This will log most of what is happening behind the scenes to the Player.log file.\n   \t* Show rolls in combat log (on by default): This will show your rolls in the combat log when you interact with a container.\n * Updating\n\t* Adds option to download the latest list of random loot items. If you wish to update manually you can do so with the download button. Changes can be found\n\t  at [LootListChanges](https://github.com/thehambeard/RandomEquipment/blob/main/LootListChanges.md).\n   \t  \n Notes:\n * The list of random loot that is possible is 3985 items from the game. This is a dump of the all the items in the game over 500gp (800gp for weapons). I have filtered out notable items, broken items, and most of the junk I believe.\n   If there is anything I have missed and shouldn't be part of items given do let me know and I'll remove it from the list.\n\t* 1583 weapons\n\t* 479 armors\n\t* 98 shields\n\t* 696 equipment pieces\n\t* 96 potions\n\t* 645 scrolls\n\t* 227 wands\n\t* 8 utility usables\n\t* 156 other usables\n * Random items are only ever given once so you shouldn't see any duplicates. This does not include basic usables.\n * You may see that you were successful in your roll but not get an item. This happens when a valid item in the level range can't be found. This is more common in the lower levels as I have filtered out\n   most of the junk items. If you crank the chances to 100% this could also happen due to getting all the items in your level range. When this happens the game will attempt to find a valid item again but\n   with a +1 level modifier. If that fails then no item is given. \n * The level range is your modified level -1 and your modified level.\n * There just isn't a lot of level 1 gear so seeing the same items during each play through or not getting any items despite success rolls is not uncommon during the start of the game. \n\t \n Future plans:\n * I would like to add the option for user defined loot tables! The framework is there to make this doable as I built it with that in mind. An example of the loot tables could be something like:\n\t* 50% chance of container containing loot\n\t  * 30% chance of a usable (roll on usable table)\n\t\t* 30% 1d4 Potions\n\t\t* 30% 1d4 Scrolls\n\t\t* 30% Wand\n\t\t* 10% Special usable\n\t  * 30% chance of a weapon (roll on weapons table)\n\t\t* *list of weapons types...*\n\t  * *more tables...*\n    You can see that tables can contain subtables making your random item experience very unique! I hope to add this if I get time...\n",

There is also a button to unlock the groups.\nThis will display all groups for all characters, even if they have no matching abilities. To add/remove abilities with drag&drop mechanic, hold SHIFT will doing so.\nSimply hold shift and drag any ability on the group's icon to add it. \\\n![add ability](/resources/adding-ability.jpg) \\\nUnfold a group, hold shift and drag an ability from it onto the map to remove it again. \\\n![remove ability](/resources/remove-ability.jpg) \\\nHold shift and drag an ability onto another ability to create a new group. You will be prompted to give a new unique title name. \\\n![creating group](/resources/creating-group.jpg) \\\nTo delete a group altogether, hold shift and drag the group onto the map. This will also prompt a confirmation. \\\n![delete group](/resources/delete-group.jpg) \\\nYou can re-order groups by holding shift and draging an ability either on the left or right side of an existing ability. \\\nPlacing it left, will move it to the left of the target ability. \\\n![move left](/resources/move-left.jpg) \\\nPlacing it right, will move it to the right of the target ability. \\\n![move right](/resources/move-right.jpg) \\\nChanges will affect all party members equally. Remember to disable 'Unlock Groups' again, otherwise you might edit them unintentionally.\n\nSpell Groups\n-----------\nYou can also create Spell Groups. They have a grey border. \\\n![example spell group](/resources/spell-group.jpg) \\\nSpell Groups behave a lot like Ability Groups. But they are unique for each character. \nYou can add any spell you like, as long as it can be cast. Variant spells cannot be added. Pick one of the variants instead. \\\nTo cast a spell, unfold it and click on any spell. Or you may click the group itself to cast the first available spell. \\\nYou may also use auto cast. It will automatically advance to the next spell, when you run out of spell slots.\n\nBuilding\n-----------\nIf you want to compile this project, you will need to download the DarkCodex repository as well.\n\nFAQ\n-----------\nQ: Why is the placement random? \\\nA: It's not. It will place it left or right of the target ability base on which side is closer. Unfortunately there isn't a visual indicator, so if you are not aware, it will appear random.\n\n\n",

    "Description": "﻿# Spellbook Merge\n\nThis is a mod for Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous. It adds additional spellbook merging options.\n\n## Patch 1.3\n\nOwlcat introduced several changes to the Spellbook Merging system in patch 1.3, that just broke the mod.\nTo quickly fix the issue I have just undid the spellbook merging changes they introduced and used the old system.\nSo people that like Owlcat's new system, you will have to wait for a while for me to figure the new system out and patch it.\nFor people that liked the older merging system, think of this as a feature instead of a bug :)\n\n## Warnings\n\n* This mod creates new blueprints and thus creates a save dependency. Once your save depends on this mod, it is not safe to uninstall it.\n\n* To be careful, install this mod just before reaching Mythic Rank 3. Test that you get the option to merge spellbooks, if not file a bug report.\n\n* I have tested this mod only with Aeon-Inquisitor, the other merges are untested (for now).\n\n* After merging spellbooks your mythic spell progression is tied to your base spellbook. So be careful when taking dips, if you don't progress your base spellbook enough, you might end up not getting the required slots to cast higher level mythic spells.\n\n* Currently for Casters that learn spells automatically (Druid, Paladin etc.), there is a bug where any new spell slots gained by merging spellbooks do not trigger learning new spells. Reload the save/game to fix the issue. I haven't tested if you can recover them if use respec and keep progressing without learning these spells.\n\n* There is an incompatibility with Tabletop Tweaks where it modifies the BloodRager spellbook. So if you want to merge BloodRager with mythic paths, disable the specific TTT tweak for it.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe patches to spellbook progressions can be disabled in the json settings file.\nIn your mod directory for this mod, you should find a UserSettings directory. Open PatchSettings.json and set any spellbook progression patch that you do not want to false.\nNote that this only disables the spellbook progression patches, you will still get options to merge spellbooks, you can just chose not to merge if you don't want to.\n\n## Mythic Paths\n\n### Angel\n\nAngel can merge with the followin additional spellbooks\n* Palading (This needs thorough testing to see if higher level spells are castable and if the progressions are applied correctly. Be warned.)\n* Sorcerer\n* Wizard\n* Arcanist\n* Witch\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Crossblooded Sorcerer\n\n### Lich\n\nLich can now merge with the following spellbooks.\n\n* Druid\n* Oracle\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n\n### Aeon\n\nAeon gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n\n* WarPriest\n* Inquisitor\n* Druid\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Hunter\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Sorcerer\n* Wizard\n* Arcanist\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Oracle\n* Bard\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n* Witch\n\n### Azata\nAzata gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n* Magus\n* Bard\n* Skald\n* Sword Saint\n* Sorcerer\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Druid\n* Hunter\n* BloodRager\n* Wizard\n* ExploiterWizard\n* Arcanist\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Arcanist\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Oracle\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n* Witch\n\n### Demon\nDemon gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n* BloodRager\n* Hunter\n* Skald\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Sorcerer\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Bard\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Arcanist\n* Oracle\n* Bard\n* Shaman\n* Cleric\n* Wizard\n* Druid\n* Witch\n\n### Trickster\nTrickster gets to merge spellbooks with the following base spellbooks\n* Alchemist\n* Eldritch Scoundrel\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Bard\n* Skald\n* Witch\n* Eldritch Scion\n* Sage Sorcerer\n* Sorcerer\n* Cross Blooded Sorcerer\n* Wizard\n* Druid\n* Cleric\n* Oracle\n* Shaman\n\n\n## Base Spellbooks\n\nThe following spellbooks have had their spell slot progressions patched to allow access to higher level spells from mythic paths.\n\n* Magus\n* Sword Saint\n* Alchemist\n* BloodRager\n* Bard\n* Skald\n* Inquisitor\n* WarPriest\n* Paladin\n* Hunter (Uses the Bard spellbook)\n* Eldritch Scion (Uses the Bard progression)\n\n\nThe patched hybrid casters mentioned above can cast 7th level spells post CL 20.\n\nPaladin progression has been specifically patched for allowing Angel merge. It has not been tested well yet. The progression is tight and slower than an Angel Oracle, but can't be helped, with the current approach. But by my estimation if you stay pure Paladin, you should be able to cast level 10 Angel spells as a merged caster once you reach Mythic 9/10.\nFile an issue report if that's not the case.\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nI would like to give my sincerest thanks to:\n\n1. Owlcat for this amazing game.\n2. My fellow modders from discord for inspiration and answering my questions. Particularly Narria Cabarius, Vek17, Bubbles and ArcaneTrixter.",

These dice are only doubled, not multiplied by the weapon's critical modifier.\n    * Second Patron\n        * You select a second patron, gaining all its benefits.\n\n* Bloodlines\n    * Aberrant Sorcerer Bloodline\n    * Destined Sorcerer Bloodline\n    * Aberrant Bloodrager Bloodline\n    * Destined Bloodrager Bloodline\n\n* Arcanist Exploits\n    * Familiar\n        * An arcanist with this exploit can acquire a familiar as the arcane bond wizard class feature. A familiar is a magical pet that enhances the wizard's skills and senses.\n    * Item Crafting\n        * The arcanist can select one item creation feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites of this feat.\n    * Metamagic Knowledge\n        * The arcanist can select one metamagic feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites of this feat.\n    * Quick Study\n        * The arcanist can prepare a spell in place of an existing spell by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. Using this ability is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. The spell prepared must be of the same level as the spell being replaced.\n\n* Fighter Advanced Armor Training\n    * Armored Confidence\n        * While wearing armor, the fighter gains a bonus on Intimidate checks based upon the type of armor he is wearing: +1 for light armor, +2 for medium armor, or +3 for heavy armor. This bonus increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 fighter levels thereafter, to a maximum of +4 at 19th level.\n    * Armored Juggernaut\n        * When wearing heavy armor, the fighter gains DR 1/-. At 7th level, the fighter gains DR 1/- when wearing medium armor, and DR 2/- when wearing heavy armor. At 11th level, the fighter gains DR 1/- when wearing light armor, DR 2/- when wearing medium armor, and DR 3/- when wearing heavy armor.\n    * Armor Specialization\n        * The fighter selects one specific type of armor with which he is proficient, such as light or heavy. While wearing the selected type of armor, the fighter adds one-quarter of his fighter level to the armor''s armor bonus, up to a maximum bonus of +3 for light armor, +4 for medium armor, or +5 for heavy armor. This increase to the armor bonus doesn't increase the benefit that the fighter gains from feats, class abilities, or other effects that are determined by his armor's base armor bonus, including other advanced armor training options.\n    * Critical Deflection\n        * While wearing armor or using a shield, the fighter gains a +2 bonus to his AC against attack rolls made to confirm a critical hit. This bonus increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 fighter levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 19th level.\n    * Steel Headbutt\n        * While wearing medium or heavy armor, a fighter can deliver a headbutt with his helm as part of a full attack action. This headbutt is in addition to his normal attacks, and is made using the fighter's base attack bonus - 5. A helmet headbutt deals 1d3 points of damage if the fighter is wearing medium armor, or 1d4 points of damage if he is wearing heavy armor (1d2 and 1d3, respectively, for Small creatures), plus an amount of damage equal to 1/2 the fighter's Strength modifier. Treat this attack as a weapon attack made using the same special material and echantment bonus (if any) as the armor.\n\n* Fighter Advanced Weapon Training\n    * Defensive Weapon Training\n        * The fighter gains a +1 shield bonus to his Armor Class. The fighter adds half his weapon's enhancement bonus (if any) to this shield bonus. When his weapon training bonus for weapons from the associated fighter weapon group reaches +4, this shield bonus increases to +2. This shield bonus is lost if the fighter is immobilized or helpless.\n    * Focused Weapon\n        * The fighter selects one weapon for which he has Weapon Focus and that belongs to the associated fighter weapon group. The fighter can deal damage with this weapon based on the damage of the warpriest's sacred weapon class feature, treating his fighter level as his warpriest level. The fighter must have Weapon Focus and Weapon Training with the selected weapon in order to choose this option. A focused weapon deals 1d6 damage, this increases to 1d8 at level 6, 1d10 at level 10, 2d6 at level 15, and 2d8 at level 20\n    * Trained Grace\n        * When the fighter uses Weapon Finesse to make a melee attack with a weapon, using his Dexterity modifier on attack rolls and his Strength modifier on damage rolls, he doubles his weapon training bonus on damage rolls. The fighter must have Weapon Finesse in order to choose this option.\n    * Trained Throw\n        * When the fighter makes a ranged attack with a thrown weapon and applies his Dexterity modifier on attack rolls and his Strength modifier on damage rolls, he doubles his weapon training bonus on damage rolls.\n    * Warrior Spirit\n        * The fighter can forge a spiritual bond with a weapon that belongs to the associated weapon group, allowing him to unlock the weapon's potential. Each day he gains a number of points of spiritual energy equal to 1 + his maximum weapon training bonus. While wielding a weapon he has weapon traiing with, he can spend 1 point of spiritual energy to grant the weapon an enhancement bonus equal to his weapon training bonus. Enhancement bonuses gained by this advanced weapon training option stack with those of the weapon, to a maximum of +5. The fighter can also imbue the weapon with any one weapon special ability with an equivalent enhancement bonus less than or equal to his maximum bonus by reducing the granted enhancement bonus by the amount of the equivalent enhancement bonus. These bonuses last for 1 minute.\n\n* Magus Arcana\n    * Broad Study\n        * The magus selects another one of his spellcasting classes. The magus can use his spellstrike and spell combat abilities while casting or using spells from the spell list of that class. This does not allow him to cast arcane spells from that class's spell list without suffering the normal chances of arcane spell failure, unless the spell lacks somatic components.\n    * Spell Blending\n        * When a magus selects this arcana, he must select one spell from the wizard spell list that is of a magus spell level he can cast. He adds this spell to his spellbook and list of magus spells known as a magus spell of its wizard spell level. He can instead select two spells to add in this way, but both must be at least one level lower than the highest-level magus spell he can cast.\n\n* Rogue Talents\n    * Graceful Athlete\n        * Add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength bonus to Athletics checks.\n    * Bleeding Attack\n        * A rogue with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogue’s sneak attack.\n    * Emboldening Strike\n        * When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws for every 2 sneak attack dice rolled (minimum +1) for 1 round.\n\n* Alternate Racial Traits\n    * Dwarf - Stoutheart\n        * Not all dwarves are as standoffish and distrusting as their peers, though they can be seen as foolhardy and brash by their kin. Dwarves with this racial trait gain +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, and -2 Intelligence. This racial trait alters the dwarves’ ability score modifiers.\n    * Dwarf - Stoic Negotiator\n        * Some dwarves use their unwavering stubbornness to get what they want in negotiations and other business matters.

Elves with this racial trait gain +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, and -2 Constitution. This racial trait alters the elves’ ability score modifiers.\n    * Elf - Arcane Focus\n        * Some elven families have such long traditions of producing wizards (and other arcane spellcasters) that they raise their children with the assumption each is destined to be a powerful magic-user, with little need for mundane concerns such as skill with weapons. Elves with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on concentration checks. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.\n    * Elf - Long Limbed\n        * Elves with this racial trait have a base move speed of 35 feet. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.\n    * Elf - Moon Kissed\n        * Elves with this alternate racial trait gain a +1 racial bonus on saving throws.

This trait replaces elven magic.\n    * Gnome - Artisan\n        * Some gnomes lack their race’s iconic humor and propensity for pranks, instead devoting nearly all of their time and energy to their crafts. Such gnomes gain +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, and -2 Strength. This racial trait alters the gnomes’ ability score modifiers.\n    * Gnome - Keen\n        * Some gnomes are far more cleaver than they seem, and have devoted all of their time in the pursit of knowledge. Such gnomes gain +2 Charisma, +2 Intelligence, and -2 Strength.\\nThis racial trait alters the gnomes’ ability score modifiers.

This racial trait replaces obsessive.\n    * Halfling - Bruiser\n        * A lifetime of brutal survival, either under the heavy burdens of slavery or on the streets, has made some halflings more adept at taking blows than dodging them. Halflings with this racial trait gain +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, and -2 Dexterity. This racial trait alters the halflings’ ability score modifiers.\n    * Halfling - Blessed\n        * Halflings with this trait receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against curse effects and hexes.

    "Description": "﻿# Toggleable Throwing Weapons\n\nYou can now use a toggle to turn daggers and starknives into ranged weapons.\n\n## Implementation details\nI overrode the BlueprintItemWeapon getter in ItemEntity and ItemEntity<BlueprintItem>. I don't believe this should interfere with anything thanks to the sea of sanity checks but cannot confirm for certain.\n\n## Cross-mod compatibility\nWorks with Hambeard's Thrown Daggers mod and automatically incorperates the daggers from that (as of release 1.0). However, the RangedDaggers and RangedStars settings must be changed from their default true to false for my mod to work! There should be no conflicts with other mods but daggers from elsewhere will not be supported automatically. If/when there is a need for it I'll rig up some way to read the guids out of a supplemental JSON.\n\n## Known Quirks\nThe item names don't change by mode. I'll get to this later.\n\n\n# Credits\n\nThanks to Truinto for the AddFactOnlyParty code.\n\nThanks to ifarmpandas for figuring out the fix for AttackStatReplacement bugs\n\n\n# Changelog\n\n\n1.3.1: Works with 2.2\n\n1.3.0: Fixed compatibility with Morvarch's Playstyle expansions - thanks ifarmpandas\n\n1.2.4: Works with the 2.1\n\n1.2.3: Hopefully fixed graphical jank for the last time\n\n1.2.2: Fixed Rogue Finesse training working with thrown weapons. Turned out to be incredibly imba\n\n\n1.2.1: Fixed interaction with Way Of The Shooting Star, should fix interaction with other attack /dmg stat replacers in general. Mod thrown weapon STR damage effect no longer force-sets stat dmg multiplier to 100%\n\n1.2: Point Blank Master (and any other ranged-only paramaterized features added by mods) now apply to thrown daggers/starknives. Increased range to 30 feet. \n\n1.1: Fixed dex to melee damage cutting out, fixed some graphical jank\n",

Is literally just Chain Lightning but dealing fire damage.\n\nFire Shield: Level 4 Alchemist/Bloodrager/Magus/Wizard/ Sun Domain, Level 5 Fire Domain. Pick between Warm and Cold shield. Warm shield cuts incoming cold damage in half, reduces to none on successful save, and retaliates with fire damage when hit in melee. Cold Shield works the same but protecting from fire and retaliating with cold.\nExisting domain picks were not removed - Sun 4 / Fire 5 have two picks. 1 round per level.\nChanges From Tabletop: Damage cancel on successful save works on all saves not reflex. Will patch this one later, if I can figure out how\n\nVitrolic Mist: Level 4 Alchemist/Bloodrager/Magus/Wizard: Fire Sheild, only the protection and backlash are both acid.\nChanges From Tabletop: Damage cancel on successful save works on all saves not reflex. Will patch this one later.\n\nEntropic Shield: Cleric 1 self-buff. Incoming ranged attacks have 20% miss chance, non-illusion. 1 minute per level.\n\nFreezing Sphere: Wizard/Magus 6 evocation. 1d6/level cold damage to a spherical area, increased damage to water subtype.\n\nChanges From Tabletop: Damage cap is 20d6 instead of 15d6 to make vaguely relevant at the same level as chain lightning/chains of fire (effectively have selective baked in), Hellfire Ray (massively more damage and defenses against it are rarer) and Cold Ice Strike (natively quickened). Available in both tabletop 40ft blast and fireball standard 20ft blast - again, to make relevant when other on-level spells have much better form factor than nuking almost everything you can see.\n\nGloomblind bolts: Level 3 Bloodrager/Magus/Witch/Wizard necromancy. Scorching ray, only dealing negative energy damage and blinding if the target doesn't save. \n\nChanges From Tabletop: Was Conjuration (creation)[shadow] on TT but that makes about zero kinds of sense so I changed it to necromancy.\n\nHeal Mount: Level 3 Paladin. Is literally heal but you can only cast it on your animal companion. At last something to do with Paladin level 3 spell slots!\n\nKeen Edge: Level 3 Bloodrager/Magus/Inquistor/Wizard. Gives a weapon Keen for 10 minutes per level.\n\nSpear Of Purity: Level 2 Cleric / Angel: Range touch attack, deals 1d8 per 2 levels (max 5d8) to target - half to neutral, none to good, unless target is evil outsider in which case 1d6 per level (max 10d6). Half damage on will save. Evil targets are blinded on save fail.\n\nTelekinetic Strikes: Level 2 Magus/Wizard buff: Target ally deals 1d4 extra force damage on natural weapon hits, 1 minute per level\n\n### Feats:\n---\nAbility Focus- Breath Weapon: Adds +2 DC to breath weapons. Requires a breath weapon to take (or mixblooded bloodrager). This prereq uses significant hardcoding to detect polymorphs granting breath attacks and hasn't been fully tested.\n\nBurn Resistance: Treat your level as two lower for determining nonlethal damage from burn\n\nDiscordant Song: Bardsong adds 1d6 sonic damage to ally weapon attacks. For ranged attacks, targets must also be in the area of effect.\n\nExtra Burn: Increases daily burn limit by two points\n\nExtended Buffer: Increases internal buffer size by one\n\nProdigious TWF: Use strength rather than dex for TWF prereqs, no penalty for large offhand weapon.\n\nSundering Strike: On critical hit, attempt Sunder maneuver.\n\n### Paladin Mercies:\n---\nInjured: Grants fast healing for 1 round per 2 paladin levels.\n\nEnsorcelled: Attempts Dispel Magic on lay on hands - does not ever dispel buffs on friendlies.\n(Arguable) Changes from Tabletop: Unlike other mercies this effect makes sense when used offensively so it works when used on enemies - it dispels buffs there.\n\n### Items:\n---\nBracers Of The Merciful Knight: Available for purchase from Arsinoe, these increase a paladin's effective level for Lay On Hands power and uses by four. \n\nBracers Of The Avenging Knight: Available for purchase from Arsinoe, these increase the wearer's effective level when using Smite abilities by four.\n\n### Mythic Abilities:\nMythic Kinetic Aegis: Treat Kineticist Elemental Defense as having had 1 burn invested for free, one more at MR 3/6/9.\n\n## Bugfixes\n---\n### Items\n---\nRadiance +6 (uncorrupted) now gets Holy like it should\n\n### Classes\nArcanist: Holy Water Jet no longer requires Azata/Angel mythic class\n\nCavalier: Made Order abilities actually show up in the UI. \n\nMade Order Of The Stars's Calling Channeling support ability work. \nChanges from Tabletop: Works on anything with a Channel Positive / Channel Negative keyword set, which means it will work on Warpriest and Oracle and Necromancer channels. No idea if it works on Warpriest fervor used normally.\n\nKineticist: Now has the Internal Buffer feature - reduce accepted burn by one a limited number of times per day\n\n### Archetypes\n---\nPurifier: Gets back level 3 revelation - TT purifier has forced unique pick, said ability is not implemented and probably not implementable so giving the pick back.\n\n### Bloodlines\n\nBlooderager Phoenix Bloodline is in.\nTabletop Tweaks Base is required.\n\n### Wild Talents:\n\nElemental Defenses and Aerial Evasion now use the main burn cost system - this is *not* disableable\n\nFlame Shield correctly halves incoming frost damage\n\n### Other\n---\nFixed extra hits: Fixed some (not all) cases where an effect that should add extra damage to an attack added extra hits instead. Currently: Firebrand, Claws Of A Sacred Beast, and the chibi dragon from Dawn Of Dragons\nONLY USE ONE OF TABLETOP TWEAKS's FIX AND MINE! The game won't load if you have both active!\n\nNote: Custom Implementation used on Claws of a Sacred Beast to preserve DR peirce properties from weapon attack isn't getting the damage type completely right - is doing all phys types instead of just slashing. \n\n## Tweaks\n---\nLittle things that aren't new content but aren't bug fixes either:\n### Spells\n---\nDispels are now buff/debuff safe - dispel magic series and slayer Dispelling Attack don't dispel buffs on user's allies or debuffs on their enemies. \n\n### Reward Feature Conversion\n---\nDawn Of Dragons gave you a perma Holy Aura effect for one resolution but this was implemented as a perma-buff meaning it wouldn't persist on respec and might be losable other ways. I turned this into a feature - see modified content for more.\n\n### Crusade\n---\nMovanic Devas now use greatswords properly\n\n### Archetypes\n---\nPurifers now get Cure Light / Cure Moderate automatically - the archetype takes till level five to not be Oracle But Worse In Literally Every Way otherwise.\n\nPurifier Celestial Armor now works exactly like Armor Training of a fighter with 4 less fighter levels - including Advanced Armor Training. This hard-requires Tabletop Tweaks Base and will not activate if it can't detect that.\n\nStigmatized Witch gets Patron selection back - I consider switching from prepared to spontaneous a side-grade at best, with Witch's weak spell list downgrading patron to curse at the same time was just a nerfing. Comes with options to select Ember's patron. Disabled by default.\n\n### Bloodline Powers\nUnlimited Sorcerer Bloodline Claws: Removes use limit on abyssal/draconic bloodline claws. \nCombine Sorcerer Dragon Claws: Unifies all sorc bloodline claw abilities into one - if you have multiple bloodlines you get the lvl 11 energy damage for every last one.\n\n## Content Modifications\n---\nNot-so-little changes I've made to base game things. These all default to off.\nThese have nothing to do with the tabletop game - my changes to Owlcat Original Content.\n\n### Dawn Of Dragons Custom Reward\n---\nThe reward for picking the good option in this quest is almost insultingly bad. A vendor trash item and a perma-buff of a spell you almost certainly already have on most paths and that Angel gets a strictly better version of automatically.\n\nThis annoyed me so I changed it.\n\nIf you enable the Custom Reward, instead of giving you a perma holy aura buff the silver dragon gives you what's more or less perma-sorta-geniekind with this setting enabled. 1d6 cold on attacks (not an extra hit just damage, it's like having Elder Frost on everything) and +5 natural armor enhancement. Overall weaker effect but one that's much less likely to overlapped. Can set to be Angel only or for all paths with settings.\n\n### Crusade Events\n---\nMade rewards from Monster Slayers and Local Production crusade events permanent if options are selected because it makes more sense.\n\n\n##Coming Soon:\n\nOver\n\nInternal Buffer will be more elegant.\n\nBloodline Mutations (Havoc first)\n\nEarth Tremor spell\n\nMountain Witch Patron\n\nBanishing Warden Paladin Archetype\n\nTwin Metamagic Rods\n\nKinetic Lancer Kineticist Archetype\n\nBasic Elemental Kinesis Utility Talents\n\nFlumefire Rage feat\n\n\n",

    "Description": "# WIT\n Pathfinder: WotR Inventory Tweak\n\n\nQuick Cast (formally known as Inventory Tweaks in Kingmaker).\nthis mod is Save Game safe, install/uninstall will not break your saves.\n\nHow to use:\n* Install the mod using Unity Mod Manager\n* The first time the mod is ran the UI might be in an odd location.\n* All four edges of the window can be clicked and dragged to move the window where you would like it.\n* The bottom corner jewel can be clicked and dragged to scale the window to your liking as well.\n* These settings will be remembered going forward.\n* The upper left jewel can be clicked to minimize the UI window.  Click the box it minimizes to to restore the window.  The minimized box can be moved with click dragging as well. You can set the hotkey in the settings menu (bottom left jewel button).\n* The upper right jewel will expand / contract all the items in the current view port\n* The lower left jewel will be for settings, this area can be used to set the hotkey to minimize/maximize the window (default: ctrl-z)\n* The lower right jewel will scale the window by click dragging.\n* There are 6 viewports, Spells, Scrolls, Potions, Wands, Special, Favorite\n  * Spells shows you the current characters available spells. As you use the spells they will be removed from the list.  If there are no available spells then the view port will say so. The first number within the circle is the DC for the spell, the second is how many more times you can cast the spell for the day.\n  * Scrolls, Potions, Wands shows any of these items that are in the inventory.  Clicking on them will use the item.  Items will always be used by the current character. The first number within the circle is how many of the item you have stacked in your inventory.  Any unstacked items, such as partially used wands will be shown in a separate entry. The second number is the amount of charges remaining.  Potions and scroll always have 1 charge.  A note on belt slots.  The mod uses belt slot 5 to handle the items being used.  If you have anything in belt slot 5 it will be removed back to your inventory.  After using a wand if there are charges remaining it will stay in belt slot 5 till something else is used or the charges are exhausted.\n  * Special shows abilities the current character has, including Activatable Abilities.  Under the abilities tab, it will show usable abilities.  You may see items listed here if you have those items in a belt slot.  This is normal behavior due to how the belt slots work in game. The first number within the circle is again the DC when using this ability. The second number is how many uses are left on the ability.  Under the Activatable abilities tab, it will show abilities that can toggled or activated, such as Fighting Defensively.  The first circle will have an X in it if it active. The second square will have how many more times the ability can be activated for the day.\n  * Favorites is not implemented yet, but it will hold any spell, item, ability that you deem to have in one place making these commonly used entries even easier.\n* To use any entry simply click on it and it will automatically use the item if the target is self, or it'll bring up the target selector UI if the entry can be used on others.\n* To Hide/Show a list of entries under the purple header, click on the purple header and it will either expand or collapse all of the entries.  Remembering the status of these headers is planned for a future release.  As of now the status will be reset each new scene that the player visits.\n\n### Known issues (I will try to keep this as current as possible):\n* A few minor graphical glitches that will be ironed out as I go.\n\n### FOR BUGS USE THE ISSUE TRACKER, DO NOT USE THE ISSUE TRACKER TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS!\n### SUGGESTIONS CAN BE MADE VIA DISCORD #mod-user-general (@MENTION hambeard#1046)\n### DO NOT DM ME WITH SUGGESTIONS.\n### ANYONE NOT ADHERING TO THOSE SIMPLE RULES WILL BE IGNORED OR REPORTED FOR REPEAT SEVERE ABUSERS.\n",

    "Description": "# Wrath Patches\n\nA collection of small patches for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. Mostly aimed at cleaning up the\ngame's log files, but fixed some minor bugs along the way.\n\nAny patch can be disabled by removing the corresponding dll from the mod directory.\n\nThanks to @Kurufinve on the Owlcat discord for the assistance and inspiration.\n\n## Current fixes\n\nNot an exhaustive list. Some logspam fixes omitted.\n\n### TypeId fix for Owlcat mods\n\nAllows the use of types (eg. Components) from (Owlcat) mod assemblies in jbp files\n\n### \"Await event system\" fix\n\nRemoves the \"Await event system\" log entries (which mostly only happens when using Unity Explorer).\n\n### Element.AssetGuid/Element.AssetGuidShort fix\n\nAdds a missing null check in `Element.AssetGuid` and `Element.AssetGuidShort`\n\n### Better EntityFactComponent exception messages\n\nImproves the log messages for exceptions in `EntityFactComponent.Activate` and\n`EntityFactComponentDelegate.OnActivate`\n\n### GameStatistic.Tick null Player fix\n\nAdds a missing null check in `GameStatistic.Tick`\n\n### Better short log exception entries\n\nRemoves a mostly-redundant verbose stacktrace from Exception entries in the \"short\" game log (`GameLog.txt`)\n\n### \"Bind: no binding named x\" fix\n\nRemoves logging for unbound key bindings in `KeyboardAccess.Bind` and `KeyboardAccess.DoUnbind`\n(\"Bind: no binding named x\")\n\n### Save menu \"AddDisposable\" fix\n\nFixes redundant view bind in the Save/Load menu. Fixes \"Trying to assign a new owner to \nBaseDisposable that already have one\" log entries for every save slot\n\n### SharedString fix\n\nCorrectly instantiates `SharedStringAsset`s with `UnityEngine.ScriptableObject.CreateInstance` \ninstead of `new SharedStringAsset`. This bug presented as large numbers of  \n\"Kingmaker.Localization.SharedStringAsset must be instantiated using the ScriptableObject.CreateInstance method instead of new SharedStringAsset.\"\nlog messages being generated. Most noticeably with the Homebrew Archetypes mod\n\n### UnitMarkManager fix\n\nFixes a \"modify collection while enumerating\" bug in `UnitMarkManager.LateUpdate`\n",
