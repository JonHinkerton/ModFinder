    "Description": "# EnhancedControls - mod for Warhammer 40000: Rogue Trader\n\nAdds UX related stuff. \n\nIf you're a user, downloads are on the right. See **Releases** link.\nYou can see detailed mod description on [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/14) or [Steam workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114200965) (or in Workshop-description.txt file).\n\n\n## How to build\n\n1. Get the usual tools (Visual Studio and .NET development stuff)\n2. Clone the repo\n3. Build. And then Build again. Project looks up your RT installation dir from your game logs (so you need to run the game at least once).\n\nThat's it. On Build output is copied into UMM folder in appdata.\n\n\n## How to contribute localization\n\nAfter installing the mod localization files are in `Localization` folder.   \nIf you named mod install folder `EnhancedControls` then full path to them would be `%userprofile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Owlcat Games\\Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\\UnityModManager\\EnhancedControls\\Localization`\n\nEnglish localization is in `enGB.json`\n\nCopy this file and rename new file according to the language you're translating into.\nRussian  - `ruRU.json`    \nGerman   - `deDE.json`   \nFrench   - `frFR.json`   \nChinese  - `zhCN.json`    \nSpanish  - `esES.json`   \nJapanese - `jaJP.json`   \n\n(If your system is set to hide file extensions and you don't see `.json`, then ignore that part)\n\nOpen your new localization file with any text editor - but for best results use something with syntax highlight - Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or something else.   \nChange **Text** properties to translate things.  \nStart the game in chosen language to see the effect. Or switch the language in settings, the mod will reload your changes.\n\nSend me translation file if you want me to include your translation with the mod.\n",

THEY MAY BREAK YOUR GAME AND/OR SAVES. ACTIVATE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**\n\n## Current patches as of 1.2:\n\n### Ported from WrathPatches\n\n- Fixed NRE in Element.AssetGuid and Element.AssetGuidShort\n- SharedStringConverter.ReadJson now correctly uses ScriptableObject.CreateInstance not the class constructor. Fixes harmless but noisy template mod localization errors\n- Silenced \"Bind: no binding named X\" messages\n\n### Experimental\n\nThese have all recieved basic testing, but are not guaranteed to be free of issues:\n\n- Swap calculations for CasterNamedProperty and TargetNamedProperty. Fix for: Some effects that should be using the caster's stats incorrectly use the target's stats and vice-versa.\n- Ignore TurnBasedEventsTrigger on features on non-party companions. Fixes the \"Infinite Seize The Initiative\" bug\n- Fixed EGSAchievementsManager NullReferenceExceptions\n- Ignore Steam Achievements with Null ID\n- Lowered the severity of missing save file warnings (\"DLC has no status in the DLCCache. Defaulting to unavailable\") no longer prints a stacktrace\n- Silenced keybinding conflict messages\n- Skip LoadAssigneeAsync - prevents internal QA error message\n",
